On a whim, I decided to get it, with absolutely no idea what this was about. It sat in my Kindle library for months, maybe about six or seven, before I finally decided to pick this up last night and read at least the first chapter and have a look at what it was.After reading the prologue and finding out that this was the zombie apocalypse from an English bulldog's point of view, I knew I just \nhad\n to read on! And oh boy was this an absolute treat.First of all, Tufo's writing is spectacular. There is nothing I can fault about it. The story flows well, and easy, and it's easy to just read and read and read without anything breaking you from the words. The only thing I do wish was that the chapters had been formatted a little better, as it was a little difficult with the chapter ending, and then there being a picture of a bulldog and \"chapter x\" next to the photo, and that was a little bit annoying.But this story was an absolute delight to read! I never really though about dogs or animals in the zombie apocalypse before, and many films, books, shows, etc leave them out of the story, as if they don't exist and this was a wonderful little book that sparked my imagination off. Riley is absolutely adorable and it really makes me wish I had an English bulldog at home; I just wanna cuddle Riley! This was also surprisingly well written considering it was from the point of view of a dog, and Tufo just did absolutely wonders.I devoured this in about an hour and a half, and I absolutely cannot wait to read the other three books in this series. I would definitely recommend this to everyone, including dog lovers! The gore content isn't that much but please be aware there is some gore in this and it won't be suited to everyone's tastes!"}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "It was a dark and stormy night. Well, actually it was a quiet night. Riley was grousing about Ben-Ben\u2019s piddle on the floor and the Yorkie\u2019s constant whining about something outside. The quiet night soon turns violent when the dogs realize the humans pounding on the door wanting in are zombies.Riley is a female American Bulldog . Solid in build and loyal to the family. Once she figures out what\u2019s going down she dons her defense mode and goes to work. The pack, human and four-legged, must be protected.But the zombies won\u2019t be denied their meal and soon bust into the house. The man and Riley put up a valiant fight but the zombies have the numbers and those left of the pack that make it out of the house alive soon realize that they may have won the fight but its only the beginning.Ben-Ben is just what you\u2019d expect a Yorkie to be like. All nervous energy. He has these spontaneous bowel releases whenever he\u2019s overexcited or scared. Which is often and hilarious.The cat, Patches, is all cat. A superior attitude and thinks about herself first. She looks down her whiskers at the dogs and humans but knows as a group they stand a better chance of surviving. Zombies don\u2019t discriminate in their munching. Animals go down just as easy as humans.Two dogs, a cat, a young girl and an infant. All that\u2019s left of the pack. Will they learn to work together? What does the future hold for them? I couldn\u2019t wait to read further.There\u2019s plenty of zombie action. Bloody bits flying everywhere. As much as it was gory, it was also funny at times. The story is mostly meat, very little fluff, so the action is fast and furious. This works really well as you\u2019re getting this story from Riley\u2019s point of view. And there\u2019s an ending, of a sort. This is one of four stories about Riley and her pack. I\u2019m already listening to the second one and its proving to be every bit as fun.Sean Runnette did a bang up job of telling Riley\u2019s story. His inflection was good and I enjoyed listening to him switch from dog, to sarcastic cat, and back again. Glad he\u2019s continuing to read this series.Thanks so much to Tantor Audio and the author for the complimentary copy.My review is voluntarily given."}, {"userName": "Hope York", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4832135-hope-york", "userReview": "Love all of Mark Tufos work!

I loved it. It's told from the point of view of Riley an American bulldog and faithful companion of Jessie and her family.The book begins with the family being attacked by zombies. The only survivors are Jessie, the oldest daughter, Zac, the baby, Patches, the cat, Ben-ben, the Yorkie and Riley. The 5 escape in a hummer and head towards Colorado where Jessie knows a boy named Justin. They encounter several hurdles along the way and with the help of the 3 animals Jessie and Zac manage to escape and survive. They stop at a house with an old couple named Faye and Winke for help but after zombies attack again they must move on. What made this book so great was the animals. The animals were able to talk but once to each other. They each had very strong and distinct personalities which made the book very enjoyable to read. Riley was the strong, loyal protector. Patches was the smart, snarky cat. Then there was Ben-ben. He was great. Ben-ben was a jumpy, timid but loyal little dog. He had the bladder of a mouse but the heart of a lion and he looked up to Riley like she ruled the world. The interactions between them all made the book. I wasn't sure if I liked Jessie at the beginning but she grew on me. She ended up learning that she needed to be brave and defend herself, her brother and the animals or at least pay attention when the animals were trying to tell her what to do to protect herself. One thing I thought was kind of stupid was what Winke did after they escaped the zombies. I get that he wanted to just go back across the street for Faye's eReader but what I don't get is why after he got it and gave it to her, he didn't protect her and everyone else by leaving. He knew what would happen. I don't want to go into more detail and risk spoilers. Bottom line is that I loved this book and I usually am not into zombie stuff. I cannot wait to read the next part of this series!"}, {"userName": "Holden Attradies", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973016-holden-attradies", "userReview": "The Zombie Lit genre is pretty full currently and I am finding it harder and harder to find books that stand out as something different. This is happily one of those books! Told from the perspective of a dog during the zombie apocalypse the story is cute, funny, and touching. --edit after reading the full book--I still feel this book adds something new and unique to the zombie lit genre and is fully worth reading, but the kind of shitty ending almost ruins the book. I understand the serial writing/release nature of publishing, and for the first three \"books\" in this book it didn't seem to hold the story back. But through the forth \"book\" I couldn't help but feel Tufo just got bored of this story and tried to tie up all the loose ends and end it as quickly as possible.The sudden death of a main character almost off screen, the way the world they are traveling suddenly became easy enough to travel half way across the country with little problems, and the reunion at the end without actually seeing it or seeing how it played out was just shitty.Bad endings can ruin otherwise amazing works of fiction, and if this is how he ends his series I'll be staying away from the rest of his works. Here's to hoping another author takes this idea and does it better sometime in the future."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19973213-brandon", "userReview": "This is just one more reason Mark Tufo is one of my all-time favorite authors. The zombie apocalypse from the view of the family Bulldog. Riley (the American Bulldog), Ben-Ben (the hyper little puppy), and Patches (the independent and arrogant cat) fight to keep the remaining two members of their pack (family: the teenage girl + her baby brother) alive as the world around them falls apart and rises back up to eat them. It's a relatively short read, but great for any zombie novel fans or even just someone looking for an entertaining light read. I'm looking forward to starting part 2 and see how it goes when the Talbots come into the picture.

It is so refreshing after the standard zombie stories, which basically read like this: - Bad thing happens; - Good people try to survive; - Bad people screw things up; - After a long struggle good people get rid of bad people and find a safe haven and live happily ever after.This story is not like this at all. In fact, Riley is such a good girl, she'd probably just carry on biting all the bad people to look after her pack.I can just see her in my mind's eye with all the little mannerisms, as well as Ben-Ben, who is exactly the type of dog that gets on my nerves cause they aren't very intelligent and extremely noisy.
