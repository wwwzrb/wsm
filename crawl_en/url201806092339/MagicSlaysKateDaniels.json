There are not enough words in the English language to fully capture the incadescents of this magnificent human being. She is beyond reproach, loved by all, exulted in her graciousness. I adore her with the nuclear reactions of a thousand suns. She is worth more to me than all of the precious jewels!*/Suck up\"The series gets good at book three.\"If I had a penny for every time I heard something like this about a series then... okay, I'd probably have about a dollar now.But still, for many avid readers out there, it is the bane of their existence. No, but really. This series gets GOOD at book three.Unlike most people though, I didn't mind it at book one. I thought it had a lot of potential. Some people get thrown off of being tossed into an unfamiliar world with little or no hand-holding from the author. Note: Ilona Andrews will never hold your hand. You either keep up or she'll leave you behind.For me the second book was an improvement but still only representative of a slightly better-than-average series. Then the third book happened. It really, really happened...Ever since then, I've been in love with Kate Daniels, Ilona Andrews, and her Edge series. Magic Slays lives up to the series fairly well.It's intelligent, witty, well-paced, fun, easy to read and enjoyable. The character arcs are all interesting, realistic, involving and enjoyable.My only complaint with this series is that Andrews is obviously very uncomfortable about any intimate scenes. She has the writer's equivalent of premature ejaculation and at one point I almost wanted to stroke the book and mutter, \"It's okay. Really. It is. It happens to everyone.\"Andrews, like Neil and unlike most of the Urban Fantasy authors, actually seems to LIKE women. The friendship between Kate and Andrea, her ward Julie and her dealings with the other women in this book is so well treated! It's a breath of fresh air to have a female protagonist who actually gets along with other women.Over all, if you're a fan of this series, definitely read the latest installment.If you're not a fan of this series - please don't shoot me but...It gets good at book three."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "\u2694 \nThe Grand IAA\u2122 KD Buddy Rerererereread Extravaganza\n (GIAAKDBRE\u2122), aka the yellow brick road to Magic Triumphs \u2694Presenting Episode 5, or How Kate Daniels Learned that Morgue Steps Can Have Very Entertaining Uses Indeed.\u00bb \nAnd the moral of this particular rererereread is:\nMutant attack poodles who chew on plastic guns + 15-year-old sex fiend/pure chick magnet + Roman the hidalgo pirate lookalike (aka Roman the Riveting Russian Rake, aka R\u2074) + duck-bunny kitties (or is it bunny-kitty ducks?

(I can't find an example to support my case but I blame the sleep deprivation,I'm sure you can think of something more embarassing than sounding like a grumpy cartoon)\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean fainted?Took a dive, kissed the pavement. Swooned like a southern belle after her first kiss. Had a dreadful case of the vapors.\u201d \n\n3.Addicted to Curran.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you?Many, many things.Curran!I love it when you say my name.It sounds so sexy\u201d \n\nLast night I wrote a letter to Santa.I asked him to bring me a possessive,jealous,violent homicidal maniac that behaves like an asshole most of the times and turns into a lion,preferably without any clothes on so I can admire his sculpted abs.No I'm not demented (I think),yes I need a cold shower immediately.4.Addicted to romance.\n\n\u201cIf I fought for them and was crippled, they would all say nice things,and then they would replace me and forget I was ever there. You would stay with me. You would take care of me, because you love me. I love you too, Kate. If you ever became hurt, I would not leave you.I\u2019ll be there. Wherever you want\u2018there\u2019 to be.\u201d \n\nOk I admit,it was this exact scene that convinced me to give the fifth star.Curran and Kate are one of my all time favorite couples,they make me swoon with declarations like this,they have hot sex that makes me blush and then they fight and kick each other in the head without regrets.Kate is still an insubordinate pigheaded ass,Curran is still a manipulative control freak,but they manage to stay together despite their differences because that's what we call love.The time has come to return to the real world with the exams and the essays,but I can proudly claim that no matter how many times Gandalf saidI ignored him and dedicated a few hours to read Magic Slays.I hope the book gods will help their faithful servant."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "Welcome to the Reader\u2019s Court of Literary Grievances\nThe courtroom was alive with the buzz of conversation. Today\u2019s case had drawn so many spectators that it was standing room only. Behind the judge\u2019s bench, high on the wall, hung an unimposing, standard-issue clock. As its hands ticked down the minutes, the excitement in the room rose and the buzz of the crowd slowly turned into a low level roar. Fifteen minutes before start-time it was so loud that people had to raise their voices when speaking to their neighbors or risk losing their words to the cacophony that reverberated around them. Every now and then shouting could be heard ringing out over the din, another die-hard fangirl losing their temper in one of the many heated debates that were taking place.\u201cHow can you even say that?!\u201d one woman screamed. \u201cAnita Blake could wipe the floor with Mercy Thompson.\u201d\u201cOh yeah?\u201d another chorused. \u201cWell Rachel Morgan is a demon. She could drag Anita into the ever after and leave her there to rot!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019d just screw her way out!\u201d yet another joined in.And so it continued. At one point a scuffle even broke out near the rear doors but luckily it was quickly broken up before it could escalate into a full blown brawl. With the energy level of the room hovering around frenetic, all it would take was one stray punch for the crowd to implode. At precisely three o\u2019clock, a door on the empty side of the bar swung open and those assembled began to fall silent. The first person to appear was the bailiff, a towering man with cold, dark eyes that scanned the crowd as he moved towards his post. Following him were the court clerk, the court reporter and finally, swathed in billowing black robes, the judge. He was not what most of the spectators expected. He was\u2026young. He was handsome too, with broad shoulders, dark hair cut close to his head and gray eyes that seemed to glow with some sort of inner power. Those eyes swept the crowd much as the bailiff\u2019s had and the individuals they fell upon seemed to cower beneath his gaze. Once he was fully ensconced behind the bench, more people filed in through the side door. These were dressed in expensive looking suits and seemed to wear similar expressions on their faces; a mix of supreme confidence and utter boredom. Only the thin bands of sweat on their upper lips or the nervous twitching of a hand gave away their true feelings. As much as they\u2019d like to pretend otherwise, this was not just another court case. These new arrivals took their seats behind the two desks that faced the judge and began to open briefcases and shuffle through papers as they talked amongst themselves. Behind them, the crowd was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It was as though the collective was holding its breath for something. The last person to enter the room was a woman of medium height and medium build with light brown hair pulled back off her face. This was clearly what the crowd had been waiting for. As soon as they caught sight of her, they erupted, some hurling angry words and threats and others rising up to shout them down in between cheering her as she sauntered over to her seat, a smirk splitting her face. \u201cOrder! Order!\u201d the judge roared, his deep voice echoing throughout the marble and stone room so that it seemed he\u2019d spoken the words three times. Something in his tone brooked no argument and the crowd fell into a low level grumbling and then finally back into silence. Those who snuck glances at him quickly looked away, unnerved by the way his eyes seemed to flash under the electric lights. Taking advantage of the moment, the bailiff stepped forward and spoke into the hush. \u201cToday we\u2019re here to rule on The People versus Navessa in the Case of the Most Badass Heroine.\u201dAnd so it began. It was the trial they\u2019d been waiting for, the one that would decide it all. Navessa's case was a good one and her lawyers well versed in both Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance. They knew the standards, knew the tropes and the themes and they\u2019d spent months preparing for this. Preparing to prove, once and for all, that Kate Daniels was the most badass main character to ever grace the pages of a book.The prosecution was equally stacked. Among their papers were innumerable quotes spoken by the many heroines that made up their client list. They had weapon inventories, outfit inventories and even in one case\u2026a boyfriend inventory. They had pages and pages of descriptive paragraphs detailing fight scenes, magical badassery, heartbreak and heroism. It would be a tough trial. \u201cWill the prosecution please begin its opening statement,\u201d the bailiff ordered.In response, a tall man with thinning grey hair moved sinuously up out of his seat and strode towards the center of the room, placing himself in full view of both the judge and the crowd. He turned towards his audience with a smile that could have sold souls to the devil himself. \u201cMy job is not to disprove Kate Daniels being a badass,\u201d he began. From her seat behind the defense table, Navessa watched him like a hawk. As he continued to speak, his low, soothing voice ringing out through the room, she realized he was good. He was really good. Listening to him wax poetic about the preponderance of evidence and the impossibility of decisively placing a single character above all others would have made almost anyone nervous. Not her. You see, she knew every single one of his clients. Had known them for years in fact. She knew their dirty little secrets, their hidden agendas and most importantly, their weaknesses. And she and her lawyers were prepared to use it all against them. When the prosecutor was done with his statement, the head of her defense stood and strode to the same spot that her enemy had just occupied. Navessa knew the speech she was about to deliver by heart, she\u2019d helped write it. \u201cKate Daniels, is a badass. This is irrefutable,\u201d her lawyer began. For the next three minutes she laid out their case in broad terms, citing numerous sources to include sales statistics, critical reviews and ratings on book related websites. It was a good speech and the crowd, which had started whispering almost the moment she opened her mouth, slowly fell silent over the course of it. By the end more than a few were nodding along in agreement. The trial lasted three days. Evidence was submitted and poured over in excruciating detail, experts were brought in followed by critics. At the end of the second day a psychologist even spoke, and he seemed to think everyone involved in the trial was in dire need of his services. On the final day, it was the witnesses\u2019 turns. It was these men and women that made the case electric, emotional and absolutely unpredictable. One woman, called to the stand for the prosecution, broke down in tears halfway through questioning by the defense. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why she had to sleep with so many men the way she did. I would have been fine if she had just owned up to her behavior but nooooo, she blamed it on the Ardeur. I hate her now!\u201d she sobbed.\u201cI understand,\u201d Navessa's lawyer smiled kindly, barely masking the predatory gleam in her eye. And therein lay the genius of their defense. For who hadn\u2019t been irritated at one point or another while reading about their favorite heroines? Who hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d acted too-stupid-to-live? Who wasn\u2019t still angry about it on some level? What Navessa knew was that the number of times she\u2019d felt this way about Kate Daniels was a fraction of a fraction of the number she had for the prosecution\u2019s clients. She knew that the amount of other readers that felt this same way might very well win them this case and so her lawyers were vicious in their cross examination of the witnesses. Closing arguments took place at the end of the third day. The same snake of a man that gave the opening statement for the prosecution spoke again, addressing the judge this time, instead of the crowd. There was no jury here today; the decision would come down to the imposing man that had ruled over the past days of proceedings with a solemn face and a quiet dignity. \u201cYour honor,\u201d he began. \u201cHas the defense proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kate Daniels is the most badass of the badass?\u201d Navessa had to stifle her urge to snort. She listened along with the crowd as this man rehashed all the evidence that supported not that one of his clients was more badass than Kate but that the defense had failed to prove that Kate was the most badass. When he was finished a few people in the crowd even clapped and for the first time Navessa felt a stab of worry. But then her lawyer was standing from her chair, striding confidently to the center of the room. She turned not to face the judge, but the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been together in this room the last three days. We know what\u2019s taken place. We know that there is one character that reigns supreme over all others and we know that her name is Kate Daniels so in closing I\u2019d like to site just one more quote and it\u2019s the quote heard round the paranormal world. The one that made us arch an eyebrow, crack a smile. It\u2019s the one that alluded to there being a new badass in town and that she was everything we\u2019d been wishing for.\u201d Here she paused for dramatic effect and Navessa's eyes swept out over the crowd. They were on the edge of their seats, their faces rapt as they waited for her lawyer to speak again. Finally she did, whispering in a low, sing song voice \u201cHere, kitty, kitty, kitty.\u201dNo sooner had she taken her seat than the javelin dropped. \u201cThe court rules in favor of the defendant,\u201d the judge spoke in the same monotone he\u2019d been using the past three days. The courtroom erupted in reaction, the prosecution shooting to their feet to protest, the crowd behind them mostly cheering but with pockets contention erupting here and there. As her lawyers shook hands and patted each other on the back, Navessa turned away and pretended to pack up some papers, her eyes straying to the judge as he gathered himself to leave. Beneath her breath, so quiet that someone standing next to her wouldn\u2019t even be able to hear the words, she whispered \u201cNice dye job, Your Majesty.\u201d The judge turned to go as though he had all the time in the world but Navessa could have sworn she caught the hint of a smile playing upon his lips.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "I would like all authors of urban fantasy and paranormal romance out there to stop for a second their feverish scribbling and take a look at this series. THE proof that YES, series don't necessarily need to go down the drain after 4th installment, that YES, series can STILL be interesting after the two romantic interests in the story \"do the deed\" and that YES, plots do not need to become unbelievably twisted, punctuated by improbable events and where mythology gets slaughtered just to get out of the bloody unplanned mess that became your story's outline.Now, instead of giving you a synopsis of the book, I'd rather tell you why this book in particular, but the whole series in general, deserved 5 stars:- because the plot is interesting, well developed, makes total sense, each book is tied to the other but still stands on its own without painful, mean and useless cliffhangers;- because romance in this book is not the vital core of the story but rather like a planet orbiting around a much substantial and well-founded plot - so much so that in the first book there is NO romance and we're still all here, inhaling every single word Andrews is writing;- because vampires, in these books, do not sparkle;- because the Andrews, when they decided to put mythology into their world, did their homework well and decided to stick with what they knew: in this book, they stuck with Russian mythology and used it in a great, clever way - there is no Russian kid who hasn't heard of Baba Yaga that I'm aware of;-because Kate is simply and undeniably the baddest UF heroine out there at the moment; she is clever, disillusioned, snarky and she kicks ass so much that I wish I was her;-because the dialogue is so full of snark, banter, sarcasm and great comebacks that I am SURE everybody has highlighted some part or the other of the book;Finally, the main reason why I think this series is so fortunate: because the Andrews are two. So what? Even P.C. Cast are two. No. I think the fact that a man and a woman have written this series together has given it a great balance. Thanks to Gordon Andrews being present, the books never get cheesy, overly romantic or dangerously stupid. On the contrary, you can see where he puts in his knowledge of weapons, fighting strategies and so on. He gives the books a masculine angle that only helps making Kate even more of a badass. The fact that the authors are husband and wife shows in the dialogues between Kate and Curran, I think.In all this awesomeness, I am not saying that the book - or the series - is perfect. There are flaws: some that have to do with proofreading - a \"door bursts open\" immediately after having fallen into the room - some with the plot - I think there is a certain confusion at times about the form the beasts take, half form, warrior form, full animal. There is a passage where Mahon shouldn't have been able to shift into warrior form yet he does - and some have to do with excessive detailing - those who followed and understood the whole coefficient and proportion thing about probability of loupism please raise your hand. Also, I was pretty sorry that Raphael was not in this book, and I expect him in the next one.Still, somehow, these imperfections do not detract from the general state of satisfaction I was left in after I read the last page of the book.

And I think I've finally come up with the answer.As the story begins, Kate is running the new agency that Curran set up for her since she has left the Order. But despite her competence and reputation, she doesn't have any clients. But just as her best friend Andrea returns from a two month absence, Kate is hired to find a missing man and the mysterious device he has built. She investigates; she is snarky; she is magic and bad-ass. But (insert light bulb here) I wasn't very invested in any of it, because Kate seemed to have no stake in it all, beyond completing a job. No justice mission like she had when searching for Greg's killer; no revenge for a brutal attack on a friend; no saving the world from a deranged aunt. Just a job.It was when Kate realized what the device could do and what it would mean to her world, that I began to perk up. And then we were off and running. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the device could have huge ramifications on Kate and all those she loves, if it is activated. And as we get into the second half of the book, Kate encounters a personal crisis, that makes her willing to risk everything to fix it. It's when Kate is desperate and loyal and determined that she is at her best. And here she shines, a heroine in the greatest sense.Curran is back as Kate's mate, and I was worried that some of the spark would be missing from their relationship, now that it's more permanent. But Kate's paranoia keeps them from falling into the old-married couple routine. She still has questions about whether things can work for them long-term. But as the story progresses, he proves himself to be an utterly worthy hero. And I still enjoyed the fire between them.For the last third of the book, I was completely unable to put it down. The ending was fantastic and sets up even more drama for the next installment. I can't imagine that Kate will be able to keep her secret for much longer. 4 1/2 stars.*ARC Provided by Penguin Group USA"}, {"userName": "Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller", "userReview": "I now count myself among the Kate Daniels super fandom.

I especially loved how authentic the relationship was between the main character and her bff. They argued like real people, and it\u2019s the kind of back-and-forth bickering that\u2019s fun to read about. In fact, all the relationships are great, and I especially love how many interesting side characters get their own spotlights in some of the short stories (yup \u2013 it\u2019s good enough to read all of the extra novellas that go along with it!).

But I guess I already said that. Uhm\u2026 oh yeah, I think I got something.I am so grateful for not having another Cat and Bones (Night Huntress) book. Yes, I like couples fighting crime together but it all has a limit. I want independent characters not a freaky Siamese-like couple talking eating sleeping and shitting at the same time. Yes, I used to love Cat and Bones a lot. Now they\u2019re boring, a thing of the past. I didn\u2019t want this to happen to Kate and Curran.Curran\u2019s absence from Kate\u2019s little adventure is a breath of fresh air in the world of urban fantasy couples. But eventually Curran was replaced by Andrea. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if this is better or not but eventually all was well. Andrea makes a good Watson to Kate\u2019s Holmes.I\u2019m so curious about Andrea, Roman and Raphael. I usually hate love triangles but this one seems to be so much fun. I am sure we\u2019ll get to see Roman again. Hell, I want to see Roman again. I loved the guy! I actually would like Andrea to dump Raphael\u2019s ass (for good \u2013 I know she still has perverted thoughts towards his furry behind) and go for Roman. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen.

In fact she did not have a single one yet. When her friend/enemy Ghastek asked her to deal with a vampire on the loose she jumped at the chance. Before she knew it, the little problem escalates into something much bigger. She now has to deal with pissed off police, her adopted niece Julie who disappeared, and accept a very questionable assignment from an elite guard unit called Red Guards. Kate's life became anything but boring.In my opinion this was the second best book of the series after Magic Strikes. It has its own share of problems, but the positive parts overweight negative ones by far. The things I do not like include the following.The authors missed a chance to show a very interesting battle with a bridge troll. We are shown Kate rushing in, the next scene start with a description of the aftermath. Was it the desire to keep the number of pages low which influenced this?I realized I do not care about Julie. I understand that she is 15-year-old girl - and we all know what is means - but I do not find a single redeeming quality in her at all. I really could not care less what would happen to her. She is a failure as an interesting character.The ending felt rushed and the resolution felt kind of on the easy side, but when you think about it, this was the most logical thing what would happen as the forces in the fight were nowhere near being equal.In the good parts I liked the appearance of some very colorful characters from Slavic (Eastern Slavic?) folklore. I did not expect for Baba Yaga to appear the way she was described here, but let us call it artistic liberty.The biggest reason for high rating was a moral of the story. The humanity created myths for as long as we can recall; some of them were very ingenious, some quite gruesome, some quite entertaining. Despite this, we - the humans - have yet to come up with a creature/monster/god/entity more dangerous than a bunch of fanatics in real life. Our collective imagination is not up to the task, simple as that. I said it was a moral, but at no point in the story this became preachy, or hammered relentlessly. Well done, dear authors!The plot was entertaining and fast-moving. Everything taken together constitutes a solid 4-star rating.

In this volume, all the magical elements- witches, shapeshifter, mages, vampires have to team up to beat a common enemy.

It is essential for her to deal with a number of things that need an adult attitude. So:1.\tFor the first time, she has a business to run with employees and bills to pay. For a variety of reasons she keeps adding employees to her business and all these people have needs, i.e. better weapons, food, food and more food, extra chairs etc.She has to be cautious about her budget and her earnings, but I am not sure she is very successful with this matter.2.\tShe is mated now. She needs to learn how to trust Curran and this is hard. She has learned from a young age that all males will eventually try to manipulate her and take advantage of her. Is Curran going to do the same? She is so suspicious and scared of this possibility, but her heart is telling her otherwise.Curran is just Curran. Just adorable. There is a scene in which he gets mad and he tears up her cookbook. 5 minutes later, he just goes back to buy her another.3.\tAs the female Alpha of the Pack: she has to\u2022\tobey rules and laws\u2022\tfollow protocol\u2022\thave escorts and bodyguards\u2022\tattend formal dinners\u2022\tbe the judge of conflicts between pack members and answer petitions\u2022\tmake decisions about other peoples\u2019 lives and\u2022\tthink about the Pack first, naturally!Kate feels her choices are being taken from her. She needs to be careful every time in order not to cause a diplomatic episode or not to test Curran\u2019s patient. Additionally, she is not sure if his Furriness is truly worried about her or if he is just a manipulative bastard.4.\tShe will learn the bitter, ugly, painful truth about her mother Kalina and her stepfather (Hint: Kate\u2019s can also be called Katenga). And she will have to deal with it!5.\tShe is the guardian of a teenager. Not an easy job. Little Julie does not behave and she does not do what she is told. Kate has to learn to be a parent and to provide parental advice.6.\tShe has to come to terms with the fact that she will lose someone close to her. This is unacceptable for Kate. And I agree.7.\tIt is about time to embrace and practice her magic!A strange machine with unknown use and a secret anti-magic society are going to keep Kate and her friends on their toes and they will add complexity to the book.Everyone who knows the secret just runs away and you have a constant feeling that the city is doomed. There will be an excellent, epic battle with all the elite magic beings of Atlanta united against the common enemy. Pure awesomeness.I truly love how the relationship between Curran and Kate develops, how their emotions deepen and explanations are given about how much they mean to each other.

Yes. I cried like a big baby. That is how great and close you come to love these characters. You think of them as real and you adore each and everyone of them.MAGIC SLAYS\u00a0is the book! Yes, the book where we get to see how Kate and Curran are as a couple, not just as a couple, but as Beast Lord and Consort. Kate and Curran were just as wonderful in this book as they were in the others. And yes, for those who will be begging to know, there is more Kate and Curran in\u00a0MAGIC SLAYS\u00a0and all I have to say is after this book, I want to steal Curran for myself.

You should look into some meditation techniques...\"\nI had to stop myself from skimming through the book for all of the Kate and Curran scenes. I have a serious Kate and Curran addiction and I don't want help. Their scenes together were absolute perfection. And we really do see how much Curran cares about Kate.

There are some things that we get to learn about Kate's past that she didn't even know and it made me tear up a bit, but that's because I love her.As Consort, Kate does have a little power and there's this one scene in\u00a0MAGIC SLAYS\u00a0where I am like \"Best Kate Daniels Showdown EVER!

The note. The flowers! O_oSeptember 2015 re-read: This book easily ties for my favorite of the series - but with so many excellent books in this series it's still hard to choose. I love it.20 July 2014: $1.99 on KindleReview (sort of):I plan to do a full review of this later - these are just my quick thoughts.I loved it!! Ilona Andrews just continues to blow me away with their stories. It's such a deep, vivid, layered world with complex characters around every corner.I liked the reality of Kate starting her own business. Of having partners/employees. The difficulties and issues that come with that and how she handled them. The growth and development in Kate and Curran's relationship is fantastic. This isn't just an HEA, ride off into the sunset; this is an HEA in progress (to steal Ilona's words). There are hurdles still to be overcome, trust still to be issues, secrets still to be discussed, and compromises to be made. I'm confident in their HEA, I know they'll never falter, never give up on one another and never let each other go...but it still takes effort for both of them at times. I like that we see that. Also the issues with Kate being the other half of the Alpha pair. There's some politics that take place in this book, and all I can say is I was cheering for Kate when she was done. Loved the way she handled a very tense situation.The action of the storyline is intense. What starts as a job quickly becomes possibly the biggest threat that Kate has faced yet. There are some mind-blowing bits of Kate's history revealed in this book. I'm still trying to wrap my head around them, and decide what to take at face value and what to dig a little deeper on.In addition to this, there's the trademark humor, smart-assedness and absolutely heart-wrenching moments. I laughed out loud more times than I can count, and teared up just as often.The last few chapters of the book are a wild roller-coaster of a ride, that I'm going to be reading again right now for what I'm sure I missed.All in all, great book, great story.

AKA I love this series and want its babies...This is the fifth installemnt of the Kate Daniels series and I LOVED IT! I completely completely consumed it this book, no page was left unturned, no word undevoured! In the last book it was left with Kate and Curran finally getting their freak on and becoming mates, and Kate starting up her own PI business with a little assistance from the Pack. In Magic Slays it has been a couple of months and she hasn't had a single client which, isn't surprising been as Ted her former boss at the Order has been bad mouthing her. But, when she does finally get her first job of finding out where a kidnap victim is she stumble on more then she bargained for and the whole of Atlanta's magical communiity have to team up or face certain death. Although I love the action packed plots of all the Kate Daniel books, in this book I found myself looking forward to some Kate-Curran interaction and was a little worried that now they have gotton together the funny push and pull of their relationship would disappear; however, it was a needless concern, the two of them have still had heaps of chemistry and the witty banter that marked their relationship from the beginning. I loved watching them figure out exactly how they were going to life together, both of them are stubborn and used to getting their own way so sparks definately fly and although this book is fairly tame in the sex department, it is mostly fade to black, you can still feel the heat between them. This book also expanded more on Kate's crazy family, and I really can not wait for the final confrontation between Kate and Roland and how it will pan out, Kate is like Spiderman she always beats the big bad guys even though she seems to have less power they they do, I just hope she can do the same with Roland. I have a feeling though that Hugh might be in the next book, her step father's prodigy and Roland's right hand man. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was that I wanted to see Andrea and Rapheal together! There wasn't a single confrontation between them! They can't split up!

You may ask why, is this book bad? Not at all, it's actually pretty awesome. Is it not well written? Nope, it's just as perfect as the others. So what is my problem? One thing, only one thing kind of destroyed this book for me, the whole \"Julie\" part.Let me elaborate. In my mind I have created an image for Kate, she is stubborn, loyal, courageous, smart, gutsy,..., and most important of all she doesn't let anyone decide for her, she doesn't follow orders, she doesn't abide to any authority. The image I have created for her just doesn't add up to a person who would take the decision she took for Julie in this book. The person in my mind wouldn't do this to someone else even to save their lives, she would find it some kind of rape. I felt like they told me for the first time Santa Claus is a myth. If she does an Anita Blake and start saying things like \"it couldn't be helped\" and \"I couldn't do anything else\" I will have to shoot something!End of mental breakdown!As for the rest of the book:Things start going south for Kate when her PI office is hired to investigate the dissapearance of a scientist. Kate manages to find that the scientist was building a dangerous machine that could destroy Atlanta and everyone she loves and now it is in the hands of a group of fanatics who doesn't care for how many lives it will cost when activated. Kate and her friends have to stop them by any way they can.\nWhat I liked in this book:\n1) I mostly liked Kate and Curran as much as I did in the other books. Their relationship remains strong but not sappy and they don't suddenly go to the toilet together, they both have their jobs and lives and they both continue to be strong minded and independed so except for the part I mentioned before these two continue to be one of my favorite couples.2)I liked Andrea again. I felt a little satisfied with what the Order did to her, petty I know but I think of it as punishment and she is better off without them. I mostly enjoyed her \"fight\" with Aunt B. I really want them to fight and Andrea to be the budda Alpha.3)I liked the story. The book didn't resolve many things in the main plot of the series (Daddy-Kate match) but it gave us enough information to keep us interested. The mystery with the lost scientist and the bad fanatics was good enough to keep you glued to the book and it was as always well written so no complaints there.4)The secondary characters were as always interesting. I especially like Rowena, Ghastek and Evdokia.As for the bad, the only black spot for me was Julie but honestly it was almost enough to make me want to close the book and save myself the dissapoinment.(almost)Deffinitely looking forward for the next one and I really, really hope that Kate will find a solution to Julie's issue. The end of this book sparks your curiosity for what is to come next but we have to wait. *snif*My favorite moments:\n\u201cAndrea raised her hand. \u201cThis is the hand that slapped Aunt B.\u201d\u201cMaybe you should have it gold-plated.\u201d\u201cHere, you can touch it, since you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d \u201cI know it's late, but could you find a book for me?
