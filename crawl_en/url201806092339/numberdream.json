This second novel is a departure from the multi-storied structure of Ghostwritten, instead closely following one character. However, it is anything but a simple linear plot and Mitchell shows once again that he can dazzle and dance through numerous facets of writing. Moving through a complicated coming-of-age tale that starts small with a quest for ones estranged father under control situations and further expands into a search for the meanings and acceptance of life while caught up in events beyond oneself, Mitchell questions reality and the nature of dreams all set to the soundtrack of the late, great John Lennon.From the very first page, it becomes obvious that Mitchell has grown as a writer in leaps and bounds from his previous novel, which was stunning in its own right. 'A galaxy of cream unribbons in my coffee cup, and the background chatter pulls into focus\u2019 is one of the first of many ethereal descriptions employed to create the dreamy tone of Number9dream. Metaphors are used in abundance to create a fanciful nature that occasionally makes the reader wonder if it is even a metaphor at all or just a waking dream. 'How do you smuggle daydreams into reality?\u2019 he questions, and this novel is the answer. Tokyo is described as \u2019rising from the floor of night\u2019, and old cook is said to 'reanimate his corpse and sit up\u2019, streets \u2018fill up with evening\u2019, and many other dreamlike, or nightmarish, images swirl from the page. There is always a question of the validity to what occurs within Mitchell\u2019s novels (Ghostwritten has many characters wonder if what just transpired really happened, Frobisher questions the validity of the sea journal in Cloud Atlas, etc.) and this book takes that challenge head on. But is it the truth that really matters? \u2018We are all of us writers,\u2019 he writes, speaking through the character of Goatwriter in part 5, \u2018busy writing our own fictions about how the world is and how it came to be this way. We concoct plots and ascribe motives that may, or may not, coincide with the truth\u2019. This is a novel about the imagination and how we attribute meaning, so truth be damned as we follow Eiji down the rabbit hole. John Lennon was reportedly obsessed with the number 9 (a very interesting article about that can be read here), which may have taken its root from being born on Oct. 9th, and continued to present itself all through his career with songs like Revolution #9, #9 Dream, and strange coincidences such as meeting Yoko Ono on Nov. 9th and that the two of them have nine letter O\u2019s shared between their names. Mitchell\u2019s protagonist, Eiji, is a massive Lennon fan and seems to also be haunted by the number 9. Like Lennon\u2019s birthplace of Liverpool, Eiji\u2019s Kagoshima has nine letters in the name. Eiji was born on September 9th, and nine years have passed since the tragic episode with his sister. This novel is oversaturated with this mysterious 9, it appears in some form constantly. By the end of the novel, readers may find themselves also obsessed with this number, counting letters in names such as Eiji\u2019s grandfather to find that there are nine letters in Tsukiyama and noticing that Eiji shows up an hour early for his 10a.m. meeting, or adding up the numbers on clock times that show up constantly revealing yet another instance of the number 9 (12:51, 13:32, 2:34, 13:23, etc.). Room numbers are 333 on the 9th floor, everything comes in nines such as the number of vehicles to arrive at the yakuza showdown, bars open at 9am, he shuffles a deck of cards \u2018nine times for luck\u2019 and thinks of Ai \u2018ninety times per minute\u2019. The book is even separated into 9 chapters, the last of which is blank because 'the meaning of the ninth dream begins after all meanings appear to be dead and gone\u2019. There are seemingly countless other examples. This book is the greatest Easter egg hunt imaginable. Beyond the number 9, Mitchell has some fun incorporating Beatles lyrics into the novel, such as describing Ai as a girl with \u2019 kaleidoscope eyes\u2019 or in a hilarious scene where Eiji gets stoned and the POV switched briefly into 3rd-person, Eiji opens his mouth to speak \u2018but his words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup\u2026\u2019. Pure genius.While this novel does not have as dramatic of breaks in form as some of his others, each chapter has a structure unique from all the rest, each with its own purpose. There is the high action fantasies of the first chapter, the reflections of the past in the second, and even an entire collection of stories and letters read later on in the novel, both with a highly original voice from the rest. Mitchell is always eager to show his versatility, and fans of this will not be disappointed. The fifth chapter, Study of Tales, is particularly interesting as it gives Mitchell an opportunity to interject his opinions on the novel itself into the plot. Goatwriter (perhaps a nod to the idea of ghostwriters presented in Ghostwriten?), is a stuttering goat (David Mitchell has a stammer) whose stories often fail since his words literally get stuck in his throat when he eats the pages. He shows how many authors must eat their words, or even be chased down by the word hounds who force them to be always on the run from their past works. The plight of the novelist is cleverly on display. This section is especially poignant today with the rise of electronic readers when the computer witch tells Goatwriter \u2018Paper is dead, haven\u2019t you heard? You shall compose your untold tales in a virtual heaven\u2019. The witch argues that \u2018writing is not about \u2018fulfillment.\u2019 Writing is about adoration! Glamour! Awards!\u2019. Here is where the true message of this books high-octane scenes comes to light. Mitchell argues against writing purely for glamour and this novel is a slap in the face to all those who write purely for a widespread audience enjoyment by becoming one of them. As in Cloud Atlas, Mitchell employs a \u2019literary pulp\u2019 style of writing to bridge the gap between literature and pulp novels by injecting pure literary depth and meaning into the pulp plots and violent scenes (the yakuza bowling scene will haunt me forever) to infect the minds of those who read pulp and show them that they can look deeper into a novel. \u2018I searched for the truly untold tale in sealed caves and lost books of learning\u2019 he says, \u2019could it be that, instead, profundity is concealed in the obvious? Does the truest originality hide itself within the d-dullest clich\u00e9?\u2019. Mitchell could write long dry novels full of depth, but it would seem that his mission is to rescue readers from their sugar-pop novels, so he writes books full of action clich\u00e9s and compelling violent plots to pull them from the depths and into the wonderful world of literature. Goatwriter\u2019s dive into the lake and his death show Mitchell shedding the worldly fears of writing, giving the finger to critics and the concept of fame, and becoming the abstraction of words and works. Mitchell lives up to this and has become one of the finest modern author. Later in the novel, Mitchell continues to poke fun at simple-minded action plots when he has Buntaro give his theory that \u2018a title ending in -ator is guaranteed to be drivel\u2026.and the quality of any movie is inverse proportion to the number of helicopters it features.\u2019The metafiction doesn\u2019t stop with Goatwriter. Mitchell has a knack for incorporating others works into his own to highlight his themes. There is a constant comparison of him to the equally excellent Haruki Murakami, both for their metaphysical and surreal styles and for their \u2018literary pulp\u2019 novels. David Mitchell is on equal footing with this highly regarded master of modern Japanese literature, and his novels should be more than enough to quench the thirst of any Murakami fan, this novel in particular. Mitchell has Eiji read Murakami\u2019s The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which serves for more than just a nod to his contemporary. The novels share many features, such as a simple quest becoming much more broad in scope and threatening, the surrealistic quality, and both novels have two women that seem to be able to enter and feed off of dreams. Another novel read by Eiji is Le Grand Meaulnes (this book plays a small role in Black Swan Green as well), which is also a coming-of-age of sorts that employs fantastical elements. The term coming-of-age tale does not quite fit this novel properly. Perhaps coming-to-an-adult-understanding-and-acceptance would be more appropriate, but rather cumbersome and wordy. This novel\u2019s humble beginnings are a quest for Eiji\u2019s father, who he has never met, and this seems to him to be the whole reason for his day-to-day life. Through the course of the novel, Eiji encounters a wide variety of people, all with goals that drive their meaning. Some are looking for their son, which presents a sort of irony, and there is some looking to get the right job, or right school, to die in glory for their country, or to bring a child into this world. However, as Eiji learns, eventually there must be some end to every quest, yet life continues after. \u2018When you win, the rules change, and you find you\u2019ve lost\u2019 he is told. To move forward in looking for your meaning, we often have to look backwards as well. \u2019Endings are simple, but every beginning is made by the beginning before.\u2019. Through the novel, Eiji often brings up a tragic event involving his sister nine years before the novels present. While he discusses it from time to time, he always beats around the bush so to speak and it isn\u2019t until the very end that he confronts it head on. He mentions how guitar had been a method of helping him get past the pain, but his life had just been a Band-Aid to cover up, not actual healing. This is his true coming-of-age, when he finally learns to accept and move forward. It is interesting how Mitchell uses landscapes to exemplify this. First, there is much emphasis of people being a part of their environment, \u2018I am not made by me, or my parents, but my the Japan that did come into being\u2019,, or 'Tokyo builds people\u2019. Also, it seems that your present location is important to who you are as he is told 'knowing where you are is a requisite of self-knowledge'. Most of the novel takes place in Tokyo, which is described in beautiful ethereal depictions, often moving up and out towards the sky and clouds. This is his escape, and his escape has now built him much like how Lennon tells Eiji that \u2018Tomorrow Never Knows\u2019 wrote him. When he returns home, the descriptions become more grounded and earthy, discussing the colors of nature, the grains of grass, and the dirt. The prose becomes overwhelmingly lush and the smells and sounds of being out in the country effluviate from his words. He is now down to earth, removed from the dream and is able to easily distinguish what is real and what are his dreams, which are easily separated for the reader. He has returned to the land, the Japan where 'all the myths slithered, galloped and swam from.\u2019 Once he has come to grips with his reality and past, his dreamlike Tokyo is literally shaken up and ripped apart, the dream shattered. This novel is incredible. It is a thrill ride through the life of the mind, through bloody Yakuza fights, hilarious first sexual encounters (he calls his erection \u2018Godzilla\u2019!), childhood memories and first loves. All the while, Mitchell pumps the pulp fiction with layers upon layers of meaning and then questions the idea of meaning and reality itself. \u2018The world is an ordered flowchart of subplots after all\u2019 he says, and this novel will make you question your own reality, much like how Eiji often wonders if he is still some child weeping in the woods and his whole life is a dream. You will also find yourself haunted by the number 9 forever after (is it only a coincidence this review is 9 paragraphs longs\u2026.?). Find this book and read it, and examine your meaning. Because maybe 'the meaning of life lies in looking for it\u2019.9/9 b\u00f6wakawa pouss\u00e9, pouss\u00e9 'The body is the outermost layer of the mind.'"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "I want to say, \"It was me, it wasn't you,\" to this novel. She and I just didn't click. She's obviously got a lot going for her besides her perfect neck, including a horribly pretentious style and a vividly dramatic penchant for detail, but while I had a very good time with some of his other novels all lined up in a row like some Voltron Robot of literature, this one just seemed to go on and on with rambling and disjointed plot-lines that EVENTUALLY, like, at the END wrapped up into the Matrix-Style \"This Is Only A Dream\" Science Fantasy extravaganza with immortal witches and people Outside Of Time that so punctuated his other novels.Don't get me wrong. I really wanted to like her. The novel feels just as epic as a wandering and hopeless kid with a very, very late destiny can aspire to. Maybe I've just run out of patience after getting through so many of David Mitchell's novels. The glorious bits are glorious, the normal bits are strongly detailed and interesting in their way, and the density of ideas is sometimes an awesome pleasure to behold.But the overall structure of these monstrosities? I Just Don't Know. I feel like I'm trying to suck a fifth of Whisky from a bottle left unbroken. I want to love the insanity and I want to love sheer chutzpah. It's always a heavy mix of traditional literature, fascinating locations, interesting peoples, and OUT-THERE SF to tie it all together like a nightmare or a dream.Indeed.

This case that I\u2019ve been working on so long\u2026On Approaching \u201cnumber9dream\u201d (A Guide for Television Fans)\u201cFirst you creepThen you leapUp about a hundred feetYet you're in so deepYou could write the Book.ChirpchirpThe birdsThey're giving you the wordsThe world is just a feelingYou undertook.Remember?\u201dIt\u2019s Juxtaposition (I Didn\u2019t Imagine Getting Myself Into)So, how would David Mitchell tell his story?How would he know what to say?\u201cnumber9dream\u201d is typical of Mitchell\u2019s writing in that it is not a straight linear narrative.It collects nine (apparently) disparate chapters and juxtaposes them against each other.I have to confess that I didn\u2019t really have a clue what was going on (and why) until the middle of Chapter 5 (\u201cStudy of Tales\u201d).Up until then, Mitchell seemed to be just assembling his paints and brushes on the table, getting everything ready, drawing an outline, only no picture was emerging.But is it too much to expect a reader to wait 250 pages before they start to get it?I think of Mitchell as a mosaic artist.I see him as an author who might feel that meaning and society have become fragmented or broken, but whose counter-strategy is to fix it by making it whole again.He is one of a group of artists who shepherds us from disintegration to integration. Individually and socially.As long as people feel that alienation is not a natural or desirable state, I will look to culture and artists like Mitchell for this experience and outcome.Yet, I had started to believe that this work might be an artistic failure, that he was trapped in mere juxtaposition.The chapters didn\u2019t seem to be conversing, they weren\u2019t informing each other, they weren\u2019t relating to each other. It was only in chapter 5 that the mosaic started to take shape for me.Father On Up the RoadEiji Miyake is a 20-year old boy from the country who now lives in Tokyo.His father abandoned his family when he was very young.His twin sister, Anju, died nine years ago when they were 11.Eiji\u2019s mother became an alcoholic, and he more or less ran away from home.It\u2019s about time he started to make something of his life.In a way, Eiji is a composite of both Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom from Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d.Eiji and Stephen are on a quest to find a biological or metaphorical father, to flesh out, contextualise and complete a family.Eiji and Bloom are on a quest to consummate or repair a sexual relationship, which in Eiji\u2019s case will mark the completion of his passage through adolescence (in the same way it does in Murakami\u2019s \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d).Joyce took 18 Episodes, Mitchell takes nine Chapters (one of which is wordless, apart from the digit \u201c9\u201d).Joyce\u2019s work is structurally modeled on Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d.Mitchell\u2019s work takes \u201cUlysses\u201d and leaps from it into a postmodern waterfall of meanings.Only, paradoxically, like \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d, he leaps upwards rather than diving downwards \u2013 hence, \u201cFirst you creep/Then you leap/Up about a hundred feet/Yet you're in so deep/ You could write the Book\u201d.Playing with Some Ballpark Figures of SpeechWhile Joyce explores different styles of writing in each Episode, Mitchell\u2019s pyrotechnics are on display throughout.However, the stylistic resemblance is most apparent in Chapter 5, where Mitchell playfully works his way through as many figures of speech as he can in the space of 66 pages (alliteration, assonance, consonance, euphony, hyperbole, puns, rhyme, probably many more that I\u2019ll leave you to detect).This happens to be a chapter in which Mitchell conjures a novel within a novel and the character in the internal novel realises that he is being written.It\u2019s important that you not take him too seriously.He\u2019s not using purple prose to display his intellectualism.He\u2019s playing with words in the most Joycean or Nabokovian fashion. \u201dFirst frost floated a wafer of ice on edelweiss wine.\u201d\u201dThe fourth noise, the whisperings which Goatwriter was waiting for, was still a way away, so Goatwriter rummaged for his respectable spectacles to leaf through a book of poems composed by Princess Nukada in the ninth century.\u201d\u201dSuddenly the sky screamed at the top of its lungs.\u201d (Note the Pynchoneque screaming.)\u201dA hoochy-koochy hooker honked.\u201dThen there are sentences you just read for the pleasure:\u201dThe naked eyeball of the sun stared unblinkingly from a sky pinkish with dry heat.\u201d\u201dA desert wind did nothing to cool the world it wandered through.\u201d\u201dThe road ran as straight as a mathematical constant to the vanishing point.\u201d\u201dA quorum of quandom quokkas thumped off as Pithecanthropus flexed his powerful biceps, drummed his treble-barrelled chest and howled a mighty roar.\u201dDon\u2019t worry if they don\u2019t appeal to you. There are plenty of other jelly beans in the packet. There\u2019s bound to be a flavour that you\u2019ll savour.Lookin' for Soul Food (and a Place to Eat)Of course, sooner or later, one of us must know that Mitchell\u2019s journey concerns stories and dreams.Goatwriter seeks out and tells \u201ctruly untold tales\u201d, yet is a character in one that is being told.A character in one of Eiji\u2019s dreams tells a story and remarks:\u201dStories like that need morals. This is my moral. Trust what you dream. Not what you think.\u201dAn Ogre in Eiji\u2019s dream warns, \u201cBe very careful what you dream.\u201dAn old lady exchanges persimmons for dreams that give her nourishment and replenish her soul:\u201dYou are too modern to understand. A dream is a fusion of spirit and matter. Fusion releases energy \u2013 hence sleep, with dreams, refreshes. In fact, without dreams, you cannot hold on to your mind for more than a week. Old ladies of my longevity feed on the dreams of healthy youngsters such as yourself.\u201d\u201dDreams are the shores where the ocean of spirit meets the land of matter. Beaches where the yet-to-be, the once were, the will-never-be may walk amid the still-are.\u201dIn a world of telephones, televisions, computers, technology, we have lost touch with the tactile and the spiritual, we have become too analytical and serious.We have lost our sense of humour and absurdity and play.We are not being refreshed the way we need to be.We are consuming too many spirits of an alcoholic nature and too little soul food. number9dream (Lennon\u2019s on Sale Again)Of course, \u201c#9 Dream\u201d is the name of a John Lennon song, and Lennon features in the novel.Eiji plays guitar and learns how to play all of John Lennon\u2019s songs.He meets Lennon in a dream and discusses the meaning of three songs: \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d, \"Norwegian Wood\u201d and \u201c#9 Dream\u201d.Eiji asks Lennon about the meaning of \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d.John jokes, \u201cI never knew\u201d (and they \u201cgiggle helplessly\u201d).John explains that the song wrote him, rather than him writing it.Character John is being a bit disingenuous here.In the song, real John advises \u201cturn off your mind, relax and float downstream\u201d, \u201clay down all thoughts and surrender to the void\u201d, \u201clisten to the colour of your dreams\u201d and \u201cplay the game \u2018Existence\u2019 to the end/of the beginning\u201d: \u201cLove is all and love is everyoneIt is knowing.\u201d These messages are consistent with the themes of the novel.Character John also reveals that \u201c#9 Dream\u201d is a descendant of \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d.Both are ghost stories. While \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d is concerned with loneliness, \u201c#9 Dream\u201d is concerned with harmony: \u201ctwo spirits dancing so strange\u201d.John also explains that \u201cthe ninth dream begins after every ending\u201d.In a sense, there is a sequence of eight dreams, the eighth dream ends the first cycle and is followed by a ninth dream which starts a new cycle.This explains why chapter 9 of the novel is blank.It is an empty capsule or container for Eiji (and the reader) to fill with our new vision.After eight chapters, we have simply reached the end of the beginning.If Sex was NineBy the end of chapter 8, Eiji has completed his quests for his father and a partner, in different ways.At the very end, we see him running from the news that there has been a massive earthquake in Tokyo.Having resolved his own concerns, he must still live in a world dictated by the vagaries of Nature.He might be Mother Nature\u2019s Son, but he cannot impose his Will on her.However, just as he might be running from disaster, he is running towards his future, hopefully towards the embrace of his new love, Ai.He is escaping from something to something else.As real John says, he is floating downstream, he is not dying.West Meets EastThere is much more I could say about the detail of the novel.However, I will leave that to you and to others to explore.I want to say something more about why I rate David Mitchell so highly as an author.Mitchell doesn\u2019t just write within the Western literary tradition.His wife, Keiko (to whom he dedicated this book), is Japanese and they lived for many years in Japan.Henry James sought to understand himself by exploring the relationship between the new America and the old Europe.Joseph Conrad sought to understand the Enlightenment of Europe in contrast to the Darkness of Africa.Like John and Yoko, Mitchell works at the intersection of East and West.While at the time of writing he understood and was influenced by Murakami, he has his own distinct and unique voice.The world is not dominated by America or Europe anymore.The future will contain (already contains) Asian DNA.Mitchell understands this and has been exploring it since he first sat at a writing bureau with a pen.His Odyssey extended beyond the Middle East and discovered the Far East (sorry if I offend anyone by using that term, but it says what I need it to say in this context).Whereas Ulysses returned home to Helen of Troy and Bloom duplicated his journey internally within Dublin, Mitchell and his characters have made their home in a global village.They don\u2019t need to return anywhere, because they are comfortable anywhere on this planet.Despite the fragmentation of society by technology and modernism, Mitchell is a Great Integrator.I said at the beginning that I wanted to make a case that Mitchell is a 21st century James Joyce.This case is closed.Postscript: \u201dIf You'll Be My Bodyguard\u201dOn the occasion of her death during the week of this review, I want to dedicate this review to Whitney Houston, who I totally adored in \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d.I wore a hired uniform for a week after that film.The film was directed by Lawrence Kasdan (one of my favourite directors, who also directed \u201cThe Big Chill\u201d, from which Kevin Costner\u2019s role as \"Alex\" - the dead guy - was cut).However, the film was also an important statement about the portrayal of inter-racial romance in Hollywood, only it involved a relationship between a white man and a black woman.Hollywood hasn\u2019t had the guts to feature a relationship between a black man and a white woman (like Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie).I\u2019m sorry if I offend anybody by saying that.David Mitchell writes for and about a world in which the answer to the question \u201chow will I know if he really loves me\u201d is color-blind.All hail, David Mitchell and the ship you sail in.Genesis 9:09 (Unauthorised)\"So they went into the ark with Noah, by twos, of all flesh and of all colours, in which was the breath of life.\""}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "A story about a 20 year old boy-man looking for the dad he's never met.

Just let it take me at breakneck speed through the underground imaginary dreamy creepy deathly tunnels and streets of Mitchell's Tokyo. (Stop trying to make it Murakami's Tokyo, Mary!) By chapter three I was immersed and thinking back to chapter one and how much fun this whole crazy book is. Escapism. I'm doing it and so is Eiji. Dozens of realities exist in our heads, hundreds of forks in the road, which would we take? How much fun is it to blow up buildings and people and be a super hero in our heads while sipping coffee in a diner and people watching?By chapter four and five I was annoyed and slightly bored. This book is like a sugar rush and halfway through it I crashed. It was like a Monday morning at work when everything is busy and phones are ringing and corporate heads are quacking and I'm zoned out and living twelve different lives in my head, like the early parts of the story....and then mid way through the book I look up and it's mid afternoon and people are feeding quarters into the office vending machine to purchase the will to keep going and I'm spent and just wanna go home already (it's hard work pretending to work hard).So yeah. This book is like that.The key I think is to just not take it so seriously. There is something sterile, something detached about Eiji and his life. His world/s are cold and dark and so is this book. Yet, it downright hysterical throughout. It's creative and different and challenging - and those are all wonderful things for a book to be."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve", "userReview": "You know those compound German constructions, like schadenfreude, comprised of dissimilar single words? Well, I\u2019ve got a new one that ought to exist if it doesn\u2019t already. It\u2019s schadenselbstungeduld, which translates roughly to \u201cthe sadness of your own impatience.\u201d Maybe you can guess why I\u2019m bringing this up. I\u2019ve had a bad case of it since last month when I joined the ranks of several Goodreads friends who have read all five of the David Mitchell books. We\u2019re now waiting long days, weeks, or, heaven forfend, even months for him to give us our next fix.As a last high from the current stash, number9dream was a good one. And the ending, about which my keyboard remains silent, made me want more \u2013 no, in fact, more than that \u2013 more to the 9th power. The main character, Eiji, is a young man with problems. Parental abandonment is certainly part of it. A separate tragedy from his boyhood is always at the fore as well. He goes to Tokyo to resolve what he can, but he\u2019s not all that practical. In fact, his daydreams and fantasies often get in the way. They\u2019re a useful device for Mitchell, though, since they give his creative juices a chance to flow (if not gush) freely. As for Eiji\u2019s real life, it\u2019s a multifarious journey. His destination is sometimes diffuse, but seems to include acceptance of his situation, love, a sense of self, and whatever else coming of age stories are meant to bring. Along the way he meets some interesting people, drawn in Mitchell\u2019s customary way to a full human scale. Eiji also meets a few scum-of-the-earth types from warring yakuza gangs. The plot features plenty of action, some that seems as crazy as Eiji\u2019s dreams. (At one point it struck me as funny that it mattered so much to me to know if a scene was a made-up dream when, in fact, a work of fiction is itself made up. But you see where I was coming from \u2013 I wanted to know what was what for the integrity of the story (as opposed to the story within the story, nested like these parentheses.)) The only points I took off for in this otherwise excellent book were for a few heinous crime sequences that I felt were over-the-top. I almost got the sense that Mitchell didn\u2019t feel the reality of them either (within the story, that is) since Eiji didn\u2019t seem as affected by them as a real, sentient person probably would be. The pyrotechnics are something I think Mitchell has always been drawn to, and he seems to have learned since how to modulate his use of them. Cloud Atlas, his next book after this one, provides all the evidence you need of his ultimate mastery. Back to number9dream and its many positives:-- The little narrative devices worked \u2013 lots of perspectives and styles including cyberpunk, crime drama (boiled good and hard), fantasy (a kid\u2019s story within the story about a goat who would sometimes unwittingly eat the pages he wrote), and military history (a moving tale in epistolary form of a suicide mission in WWII).-- Eiji is a very likable character. You\u2019re happy for every small victory and anxious with every new threat.-- The young lady he likes, the waitress with the beautiful neck and sublime musical talent, is wise beyond her years. She\u2019s given some thought-provoking lines.-- Those of us who are big DM fans have always liked the way he writes. He has fun, he chooses his words well, and he\u2019s very creative with both structure and concept. That\u2019s all in evidence here.-- People tell me that after DM, HM (Murakami) should be next. Is The Wind-up Bird Chronicle a good choice?I\u2019ll end this with a personal note to David since he seems likely to respond to the pleas of his devoted fans. Will you please hurry up with that next one?! You don\u2019t seem like the type to revel in schadenfreude at our collective schadenselbstungeduld."}, {"userName": "Peter Boyle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle", "userReview": "Do you ever set books aside for a special occasion? I like to keep certain novels on hold for holidays, so that when I reminisce about a particular vacation, I will also think about what I was reading at the time. I have very fond memories of devouring The Goldfinch on a visit to London a couple of years ago, and being so immersed in the story that I almost missed my plane. David Mitchell is one of my favourite writers and I had been saving number9dream for a while now. I took it with me on a trip to Munich last week and I'm happy to report that it didn't disappoint.Eiji Miyake is our hero, a nineteen-year-old boy from the tiny island of Yakushima off the coast of Japan. He arrives in Tokyo on a mission to locate his father, whom he has never met. Eiji feels alone in the world, abandoned by a troubled mother and still mourning the loss of his beloved sister Anju. But his visit to this restless, pulsing city will take on him a wild adventure of gangsters, hackers and potential love interests. Whether or not he finds what he is looking for, his life will never be the same again.Eiji is a daydreamer and dreams are a very important part of this novel. Indeed the story begins with a number of his fantasies as he summons the courage to enter the office of his father's lawyer. It gives David Mitchell the license to exercise his colourful imagination - Eiji pictures himself assassinating Yakuza mobsters like a scene from an action movie, and becoming the saviour of a flood that rapidly engulfs the city. Later on the book Eiji's dreams seem to take on greater meaning, as his subconscious attempts to make sense of everything that has happened to him on his Tokyo expedition.Readers of David Mitchell will know how ambitious his novels are, and it is something I admire him for. He takes great risks with structure, and number9dream is no different. We are served up stories within stories - one chapter contains excerpts from the journal of Eiji's great uncle, a suicide bomber during World War II. In another section Eiji hides out at the home of a writer and passes the time by reading her latest manuscript, which features three talking animals who ride around in a self-driving coach. Parts of this bizarre tale are interspersed with the main text.Not all of these literary tricks work and to be honest I grew a little weary of the distractions from the principal story. Though dreams have a major role to play in this sprawling tale, it works best when it is anchored in the real world. The slow blossom of Eiji's relationship with Ai, his desperate longing for his unseen father, his heart-wrenching memories of Anju - these were the parts of the novel I loved most and will remember.This was Mitchell's second novel and it is the work of a writer still honing his craft. Though it doesn't quite hit the heights of Cloud Atlas, it is a true delight to experience his unfettered imagination in full flow. number9dream an audacious, dazzling book - an acrobatic feat of storytelling that never fails to entertain."}, {"userName": "Stephen M", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m", "userReview": "A Study of Tales or \u201cLike watching a musician play his scales very, very well\u201dSourceThe tension between style and substance dominates a significant portion of the David Mitchell conversation. Fairly consistently Mitchell\u2019s writing falls into the style side of this writing dichotomy. As with anything, it's an issue of taste for anyone who has dipped their hand into the creative writing pot. It splits writers of all different stripes, in genre, literature or otherwise with geniuses on both sides. To me, the definitive distinction falls between those one care more about the content that the words purport to signify versus those who care more about the words themselves, deriving aesthetic pleasure from the effect that words can have, even if tangentially related to their referents. Finding a particular niche in workshops and MFA circles, accusations of purple prose and self-indulgent descriptions fly freely from minimalist tongues towards those of the latter camp. I am an inveterate defender of that latter camp. I've always considered content to be accidental; I read literature because I love words. I want to be dazzled by what they are capable of on their own, unburdened by the requirements of their referents.I think anyone with a taste for poetry and excessive prose will agree with these sentiments. When I declare Mitchell a brilliant writer, I don\u2019t mean it any capacity to strip down the prose and tell some brutally honest tale in the Hemingway sense; he\u2019s not in that business. I don\u2019t mean to say that he spins out a deft plot, a wildly original story (he wears his influences on his sleeves) but rather, I mean that David Mitchell is a level-ten wordsmither, capable of making any situation, no matter how banal or derivative come alive with soaring prose. Goatwriter, the stutterer, writes an untellable storyI think that the frustration that most people find with this book is that it's scatterbrained and unfocused. My previous apologetic move was to point out a flaw in Mitchell\u2019s ambition that he tried to cover too much ground and was unable to make good on his original intentions. Upon a second reading, I now see that the book is exactly as it should be. What seems to be a mess of splintered threads and tangential story lines is really the product of a book about the search for meaning. As it is with any book that treats this topic (Crying of the Lot comes to mind), it is part of the function of the book to simulate the frustration that arises from seeking meaning out of a chaotic external world. On the one hand, Mitchell is showing us all the literary gymnastics he is capable of pulling off. On the other hand, he is imbuing us with the experience of Mr. Eiji Miyake, a twenty year old cast away in the big city for the first time, confronted with first loves, loss of innocence, struggling to find out what it is that matters to him. Of the thousands of avenues into the buildingsroman, Mitchell takes this route, an exploration into the fertile time period of your 20's ripe with existential crises, one night stands and cigarettes.Confusion is justified. On my first reading, I was thoroughly confused by the misadventures of Goatwriter in his anthropomorphic fantasy land. Now it is my favorite part of the book. It is full of genuine hilarity and brilliant wordplay and it highlights the struggle to reach some elusive, ultimate meaning. It seems so ineffable. The only true story and the ultimate meaning therein is the one that hasn\u2019t been told, the ninth dream that begins when all other dreams fall away.Meaning is what we intuit from disparate facts after we\u2019ve exhausted all immediate evidence. The ninth dream is a blank slate for the reader to project his/her meaning upon the book. The final words of anything hums with significance, a real goosebump affair that sends the reader back to the beginning to begin his search for meaning all over again."}, {"userName": "tim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/230113-tim", "userReview": "Number9Dream, what is a relatively administered star-rating system compared to the joy I experience while reading you?

Follow Miyake as he smokes, gurns, fantasises and bull-shits his way around Tokyo trying to find his long-lost Pops and enjoy the literary games and jousting word-smithery that accompanies this. David Mitchell has once again cleared his literary throat and spewed forth a load of different writing styles. Mostly you are left with the impression that he write to amuse himself; it's a way of stretching some newly formed literary muscle that he's developed. Very clever Mr Mitchell, and better than Cloud Atlas (for me anyway), but cleverness and a big collection of exercises in grammatical madness be it alliterative, metaphorical, tautological, allusion or allegorical can only take you so far before the reader decides they don't want to have to look that hard for a story within a complexly constructed chain of words.

This is my last Mitchell book left to read (I am now a Mitchell completist) and I was hoping for just a little more PoMo juice to squeeze out of his second novel. Three dreams into it and I was afraid Mitchell was aping Murakami (Norwegian Wood, A Wild Sheep Chase) and Joyce (Finnegans Wake) a bit too much in his persuit of a dreamy father-quest novel. By the end, however, Mitchell salvaged the novel. It still seemed a little too packaged, too sterile, too neat and measured.

I'm just so in awe of the bizarreness of number9dream that my thoughts are not settled on the book.Okay what I want to know is what David Mitchell was taking when he wrote this...so I can join in with the elixir! Seriously this is a whacked out, crazy kind of book that's strangely compulsive reading but doesn't make a lot of sense in places. I must admit that the whole time I was reading it went like this:First few chapters: Interesting, like the little anecdotal stories, don't see what they have to do with anythingAround 100 pages: Hang on the protagonist did what? What's he doing in that weird hotel (this was the part that I personally hated the most)Around 200 pages in: Still doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's gripping reading300 pages in: I still don't get it...400 pages in: Done, I still don't get it, it's like a roller coaster ride on hallucinogens (not that I know what hallucinogens are like), fun but you don't know what ride you were on exactlyThis was my second try at David Mitchell and I must say that this was as far from my usual reading as anything I have read. It was very, very different to Cloud Atlas. Where I saw some interesting ideas in Cloud Atlas, a kind of depth (personally) beyond the stylistic choice of writing, number9dream was more about the stylistic choices and fun entertaining tale than any depth. I think I'll have to try the other three David Mitchell books I have waiting to read rather than mull over this.The plot of this is 'boy tries to find father in city, never having met Dad.' Yes the plot has been done to death but the way it is done is what matters and I think Mitchell was trying to write this book in a way to show that sometimes in life dreams turn out in the end to be disappointing failures and not how we think they should turn out. I think his encouragement is that that doesn't matter, that it is the process of trying to find our dream and who we meet that counts. Along the way through this story Mitchell throws in other little stories (humorous stories about religion which I found quite amusing), references to John Lenon, a diary of a human torpedo, sci-fi technologies and a whole plot involving the Yakuza.On the whole a bizarre and zany novel with lots of quirkiness, but still highly entertaining. It was also a very fast read, much faster than Cloud Atlas but I didn't like it as much. If you liked Cloud Atlas you might like this. If you hated Cloud Atlas you might still like this.

Beaches where the yet-to-be, the once-were, the will-never-be may walk amid the still-are\u201dnumber9dream is the second novel by British author, David Mitchell. Nineteen-year-old Eiji Miyake arrives in Tokyo looking for his father, a man he has never met, a man whose name he does not even know. He has a letter from a lawyer warning him not to try to find his father, so his first move is to stake out the lawyer\u2019s office from a caf\u00e9 opposite, the Jupiter Caf\u00e9, where works a girl with the most beautiful neck in the world. So begins another foray into the world of David Mitchell, one that takes the reader on an interesting (and occasionally, slightly bizarre) journey. As Eiji moves from the caf\u00e9 to the Lost Property Office of Ueno station to a game parlour to an unfinished development on reclaimed land to a safe house to a video shop to a pizza shop to a mountain retreat, he also moves in and out of danger and encounters quite a cast of (often quirky) individuals. Claude Debussy and John Lennon play significant roles, as do the Yakuza organised crime syndicate, an overabundance of cigarettes, some seriously weird pizza recipes, a cat, an absent mother and a dead twin sister.Mitchell manages to seamlessly include the journal of a WW2 Kaiten pilot, scenes from a surreal black and white movie, a fantastic tale starring a stuttering goatwriter, a hen and a Pithecanthropus, an account of sex slavery and organ theft, and, of course, quite a few dreams. The number nine and its elements, unsurprisingly, feature heavily but in quite a subtle way. As with all of Mitchell\u2019s novels, there are characters who appear in earlier and later books. Mitchell\u2019s characters, for all their oddities, are appealing; their dialogue and Eiji\u2019s inner monologue provide plenty of humour; and they manage to express some insightful observations: \u201cWeird.

Reminiscent in many ways of a Haruki Murakami novel, \"number9dream\"'s propensity to shift between the real and the imagined burdens the novel with a frustrating format despite the compelling story that lies at the novel's core. Set in Japan, where Mitchell spent eight years of his life, \"number9dream\" follows Eiji Miyake as he goes on a quest to find his estranged biological father he has never met. The novel is divided into 9 chapters, each with a different companion story that accompanies and reflects Miyake's journey through modern Tokyo. The opening chapter itself is frustrating in that the repeated, albeit altered, fantastical situations dreamed up by Miyake are never revealed as fantasy; it is up to the reader to discover the imagined nature of the proceedings for themselves. Despite this extremely confusing and willfully obtuse opening, Eiji Miyake's character is quite likeable and his journey for discovery is thoroughly interesting. Miyake's blunders through minimum wage jobs, finds himself in the middle of a Yakuza feud, slowly falls in love, all the while maintaining his unique perspective and disposition.  Another aspect of the book that is immensely enjoyable is the depiction of Japan. I have previously enjoyed Mitchell's superb \"The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet\" for its portrayal of the port city of Dejima in the year 1799 and the appreciation and understanding that he brought to Japanese culture. Proving he has a keen eye for the culture in multiple eras, \"number9dream\"'s modern Japan is wholly realized and believable despite the fantastical and psychedelic sections that permeate most of the book. As an addendum to my aforementioned complaint, not all of the sections are frustrating and some of them do end up being quite enjoyable. In particular, the \"Kai Ten\" section was easily my favourite as it brought Miyake's quest to a more fulfilling conclusion than his previously intended goal. As for to whom I would recommend the novel, it's a tough one. Fans of Mitchell's more recent output may be frustrated with the book, but I think that Murakami fans may find a lot to like. Experimental in an entirely different way from his other novels, \"number9dream\" just failed to resonate with me to the same degree as Mitchell's other novels."}, {"userName": "JSou", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1020084-jsou", "userReview": "REASONS I LOVED THIS BOOK:-It is by David Mitchell-It made me want to go have sushi & sake bombs-It was surprisingly funny-Not only did it remind me of Murakami, it referenced The Wind-up Bird Chronicle-It had the word \"knickerbockers\"I was rating this in my head as I went along (something I can't help but do since joining goodreads), and for the first part, I was liking it and thinking 3 stars. Once I hit the halfway point, the Mitchell I know and love emerged, bumping it up to a four. By the end of the novel, there were some solid 5 star passages.Set in Tokyo, Eijii Miyake is on a quest to find the father he's never met. His character is slowly revealed not just by his actions, but also through his various dreams. Usually, my eyes start to glaze over when reading about dreams (or song lyrics), but in this, it worked. \"How do you smuggle daydreams into reality?\" Mitchell was able to do this brilliantly, showing that reality is constantly different than what we have going on in our innermost thoughts.

Although it has eight chapters and each has a name, the author ends the book with the ninth chapter which is simply called \"Nine\" and left empty. \"The ninth dream begins after every ending\", says David Mitchell, continuing the subtle insinuation that the story is to be continued in our imagination, but taking into account several clues from the last chapter: \"Time may be what prevents everything from happening at the same time in waking reality, but the rules are different in dreams.\" In dreams everything is possible, characters from different moments of our lives gather to recreate parallel realities, to embody different personalities. Dreams play with reality like kids with plasticine and create alternative meanings which having been auditioned by the present or the past, had been rejected in order to give way to other story-threads (the actual reality). The energy generated by our dreams constitute the nourishment of the witches who are still among us, but because our \"world is lit by television, threaded by satellites, cemented by science\" admitting their existence seems far-fetched for \"the nowadays us\". \"Dreams are shores where the ocean of spirit meets the land of matter. Beaches where the yet-to-be, the once-were, the will-never-be may walk amid the still-are.\"The alternance between dreams and reality is fascinating in this story and the main character ends up wondering if he is a dream of the real Eiji Miyake and when he goes to sleep and dreams, the real Eiji Miyake wakes up and remembers his waking life as a dream. Mitchell succeeds in writing a great final chapter for a book which at some points seems unfocused, with details that could be easily skipped without altering the story.It's obvious all the way through the book that he is a great fan of Murakami's: not only does he say that the main character, Eiji, is reading \"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\", but he seems to even adopt Murakami's style and adapt it to his own way of creating literature. Moreover, Eiji is alike in many ways with Kafka Tamura from \"Kafka on the Shore\" by Murakami, and all the other characters seem to borrow something from the oddity and charm of Murakami's characters. Maybe it is just my impression, but the author himself declares openly to hold Murakami as a great source of inspiration.Although I kept wondering while reading this book whether I was really enjoying it or not, the ending somehow brought all the loose ends together and I ended up thinking that it was really worth reading it. Moreover, although the story might not seem very catchy: a young boy starts a quest for his father whom he has never met, Mitchell's very plastic phrases and original use of words, his very creative, unique way of expressing his ideas and his humor create a special reading rhythm which is very entertaining. Therefore, although it seems a light read at a superficial level, once the hidden meanings and metaphors begin to unravel, they just pop out in your head continuously...like a bag of popcorn in the oven which seems unable to ever stop."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "Eiji Miyake is looking for his father but he finds many different things\u2026\u201cSqueeze, squelch, squirt.

And so, in what is probably the most straightforward plot of a boy in search of his father, the author packs a whole lot of freudian pyrotechnics that blur lines between plots, between genres and between reality.Eiji Miyake reaches 'Tokyo' in search of his father. The Tokyo of Mitchell is a surreal place with characters constantly in search/with dreams of something. The first chapter with sequence of dreams to find the identity of his father is sufficient to discourage a rational reader on the lookout for a conventional read. And then to the pleasant surprise the book introduces characters that recur across chapters! (a first for Mr.Mitchell). But that is about as normal as it would go.We have underground mafia pulp fiction, psychedelic video game narratives, war memoirs, weird erotica of sorts (for the lack of better word) all are made to fit into the narrative. In one of the chapters we see a stuttering novelist Goatwriter in search of an untold story along with his hen assistant and neanderthal assistant which is a meta on the novelist. In another, we meet John Lennon who discusses his songs in a dream state. Plus the #9 Easter egg which you keep ticking off in your head whenever you encounter.  \"#9dream is a descendent of Norwegian Wood says John Lennon\"  A reference to both the songs by John Lennon and an veiled flattery to Haruki Murakami. (About time I picked up a Murakami)The eruption of fantastic stories weave around the ordinariness of Miyake's 7 weeks in Toyota. His work in the lost property office, the video parlor or later on at Nero's pizza, his sleepless nights looking at the Neon clock, the Cat and the Cockroach as roommates are written absorbingly. The subtle romance between Ai Imagio and Eiji is warm and so is the friendship with his unlikely friends of Suga the hacker and Banturo his landlord. In addition we have the changing cigarette brands that is maddening for a reader which makes you wonder if the entire book is actually a lucid dream of an insomniac. In fact, the book will make you wonder if you dreamed reading the entire book. Genius tribute of Mitchell.

Since then I have read most of David Mitchell's stuff, but number9dream was my first, so it retains pride of place. I was turned onto it the winter I went home to Canada for Christmas because for some reason that year I decided I was going to read everything shortlisted for the Booker Prize (I did and they were all excellent reads: Oxygen, Hotel World, The Dark Room, Atonement and the winner (don't ask me how) The True History of the Kelly Gang). I knew Ian McEwan and Peter Carey, but I came to the other four authors for the first time. number9dream was the first of the six books I read, and by the time the prize was awarded it was still my favourite. Fourteen years later and I just spent a week and a bit dragging it around from beach to beach, rediscovering the rhythms of David Mitchell's writing -- reminding myself why I love him so much. I don't think I would give number9dream five stars anymore, but I would still give it a strong four (I'm leaving my original stars up regardless), and I don't think my slight distance from loving this book is all that much of a drop off. In many ways the story of Eiji Miyake is irrelevant when it comes to my final feelings about this book because it wasn't so much the story that made me love number9dream as the storytelling, and no matter the characters no matter the plot, if David Mitchell is telling the story, I am going to set the book down with a mixture of sadness and joy. Sadness that the storytelling is over; joy that I had the privilege to listen to his voice for a little while. But since this is a pseudo-review, here's the one specific thing I will say about number9dream.

But I figure that being this conflicted between ratings probably means that I should err on the side of the fewer stars. Still: My kingdom for a half-star option!There are lots of things I liked. Eiji, the main character, remains likable even as he's shuttled between hell and back, like, five thousand times in 400 pages and disappointed by nearly everyone who matters to him. There's a chance that his blossoming relationship with Ai contributed to my increasing fondness for him but I'm okay with that because their last exchange of the novel was so believably reminiscent of what it's like to be 20 and falling hard for someone you don't quite know. I liked the dreamy, Murakami flavor, especially after finding out that Mitchell counts him among his influences (according to the internet, which I totally trust all the time). I liked the David Mitchellness and how minute details wind up mattering very much, though I think his hallmarks are far less defined here in his sophomore effort than they are even in his debut novel. References to \"The Man in the High Castle,\" \"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\" and some music for which Eiji and I share an affinity were all tasty bonuses -- what can I say? I've got a mile-wide soft spot for fictional characters who have the same tastes as I do.But there were also things I wasn't so crazy about in this book. It felt a little disorganized, which, intentional or not, didn't sit perfectly well with me. Some characters and a few scenes hogged a few too many pages: Had I found Eiji a little less interesting, the many detailed accounts of his odd jobs would have been downright tedious. And, okay, fine: The ending was a little too abrupt for me to be satisfied with it. Though I suppose having my way would mean that every book I ever read is at least 100 pages longer than the author intended. Ultimately, this book suffers as \"Player Piano\" did, in that I'm cherry-picking my way through a writer's back catalog instead of chronologically working my way to the newer stuff: When I was planning this winding-down tour of my literary favorites' unread offerings, I actively chose \"Number9dream\" over \"Thousand Autumns\" in anticipation of that very reason. The lingering, negligible sense of dissatisfaction this book left me with is very much appeased by knowing that my sole remaining to-read Mitchell book is his most recent piece."}, {"userName": "Monique", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4111021-monique", "userReview": "No less than 5 amazing stars.

No one can do that to me and totally awe me like Mitchell just did. 2. Is this metafiction? Are there traces of metafiction in this novel? If the answer is yes to either question, then I think I could definitely get used to the genre. 3. \"Maybe the meaning of life lies in looking for it.\" 4. Study of Tales. Story within a story. Within a story. 5. There is no question now about Mitchell's writing talent - to echo a buddy's observation, is there anything the guy couldn't do? He can write convincingly as a different person, all within a single novel. He jumbles and interjects the literal with the figurative. He's like a literary architect who combines various structural motifs to make a fabulous whole. 6. Notwithstanding the reading slump I endured while this book was on my currently-reading shelf, its appeal did not diminish the least bit. That tells a lot about how awesome this book is, doesn't it?7. It made me curious about John Lennon's song, #9dream, from which the title is derived. Because of this, I'm set to make a playlist devoted solely to songs mentioned in books. 8.

Cada uno de los lectores es v\u00edctima del suyo propio. Hay libros como Lolita que no est\u00e1n hechos para todo el mundo. Autores que se resisten por mucho que uno lo intente pero tambi\u00e9n otro tipo de barreras. El de Number9dream es el idioma. Pero no os asust\u00e9is antes de tiempo, David Mitchell asusta pero no tanto. Simplemente hay que tener cierto nivel y paciencia, paciencia para entender qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando. Paciencia para avanzar mucho m\u00e1s lento que de costumbre con un libro en ingl\u00e9s que normalmente no te cuesta leer tanto. Superado ese reto Number9dream es todo vuestro. O casi. Si la memoria no me falla, creo recordar que este es el segundo libro del autor, publicado por primera vez en 2001 (o as\u00ed), y dir\u00eda que un segundo \"acto\" lo suficientemente impresionante para gustar hasta a los lectores m\u00e1s exigentes. Eso s\u00ed, haters de Haruki Murakami, es mejor dejar pasar este, pues no en vano en la ficha de Goodreads del autor figura el nombre del autor nip\u00f3n. Y es que David Mitchell supo plasmar algunos de los elementos que m\u00e1s le caracterizan y adaptarlo a su estilo. Aqu\u00ed no hay chicas con orejas perfectas, pero s\u00ed cuellos perfectos. Los momentos de realismo m\u00e1gico quiz\u00e1s puedan chocar demasiado al principio, y confundir al lector hasta el punto de no entender qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando, (algunas cosas sigo sin entenderlas incluso ahora) pero en su conjunto Number9dream es una novela que pese a sus defectos sigue siendo maravillosamente construida, escrita y, sobre todo, ambientada.Eiji Miyake es un joven de 19 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1 dispuesto a todo para encontrar a alguien. Para ello decide dejar todo atr\u00e1s y mudarse a Tokio donde est\u00e1 la \u00fanica pista que tiene para encontrar alg\u00fan rastro m\u00e1s sobre el paradero de su padre. Sobre qui\u00e9n es \u00e9l. Necesita respuestas aunque por ahora ni siquiera tenga claras las preguntas. Buscar a alguien sin saber si quiera su nombre en una ciudad como es Tokio puede ser un completo suicidio y Eiji lo sabe bien, sabe que esto le llevar\u00e1 su tiempo. Busca trabajo en diferentes lugares de la ciudad, alquila una peque\u00f1a habitaci\u00f3n en un hotel c\u00e1psula en el cual se hace amigo de su propietario pero tambi\u00e9n hace una serie de curiosas amistades, cada cual m\u00e1s extra\u00f1a que la anterior. Number9dream es en ese aspecto una caja de personajes extravagantes. La primera, una camarera que trabaja en una cafeter\u00eda a la que Eiji va muy a menudo y que aparecer\u00e1 en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n a lo largo de la novela. La hermana de Eiji, a la que conocemos poco a poco, a medida que \u00e9l se va acordando de historias de cuando eran peque\u00f1os y viv\u00edan los dos con su abuela. Yuzu Daimon, al cual conoce de casualidad y quien le arrastrar\u00e1 a una de las noches m\u00e1s locas de toda su vida. Buntaro, su mujer y su madre, un tr\u00edo al que Eiji coger\u00e1 much\u00edsimo cari\u00f1o. Todos ellos tendr\u00e1 algo que aportar en la vida de Eiji. El patr\u00f3n que usa David Mitchell recuerda much\u00edsimo a Murakami. El abandono de un ser que se busca desesperadamente. Una chica de la que uno acaba prendado de un modo u otro, ya sea por su oreja o su cuello perfecto. Pero sobre todo una corriente invisible que aunque a primera vista parece que no nos est\u00e9 llevando a ning\u00fan lado, en realidad nos hace avanzar continuamente.Pese a sus extravagancias, situaciones inveros\u00edmiles que a ratos cuesta pillar y una cantidad de situaciones cotidianas enorme, la historia de Number9dream es m\u00e1s bien simple; Eiji hace todo lo posible para encontrar a su padre, aunque las consecuencias pueden ser catastr\u00f3ficas. A su vez su madre busca su perd\u00f3n, por eso, por medio de una serie de cartas lograremos entender un poco mejor por qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 haciendo todo esto. Cu\u00e1l es el sentido de este viaje. Para qu\u00e9 sirve aguantar ciertas cosas y poner su vida en peligro. Y es que una de las cosas m\u00e1s extra\u00f1as que he le\u00eddo en este libro (y eso que he le\u00eddo cosas extra\u00f1as aqu\u00ed) pero a la vez m\u00e1s t\u00f3pica si lo pienso bien, es que uno de los hilos argumentales de la novela tiene que ver con los yakuzas. No s\u00e9 si la idea inicial era incluir ese arco ya desde que David Mitchell pens\u00f3 en la novela o si simplemente la quer\u00eda hacer lo m\u00e1s asequible posible a sus lectores. Y es que al igual que pasa con Murakami, Number9dream es un libro bastante \"occidentalizado\", de tal modo, que perfectamente podr\u00eda haber pasado en Nueva York y el protagonista llamarse Alex, aunque no ser\u00eda lo mismo. Pues lejos de la importancia de la historia en s\u00ed, la ambientaci\u00f3n general de Number9dream resulta ser una experiencia exquisita para el lector.Algunos lectores puede que queden un tanto desencantados con el conjunto. Un todo-esto-para-qu\u00e9 pero realmente aqu\u00ed lo que importa es el camino y no el resultado final. A veces puede parecer un poco repetitivo, a veces, parece que las cosas se quedan estancadas pero el arco argumental llega a su fin. Todo se acaba. La historia se cierra. Y t\u00fa te preguntas si hubieras hecho lo mismo que \u00e9l al final. Si hubieras formulado las preguntas. Si hubieras hecho todo esto. Si val\u00eda la pena.

Luckily, when everybody else foolishly headed out for a New Year's Day walk in the rain I was able to raid my host's bookcase and grabbed a copy of David Mitchell's number9dream; I'd enjoyed Cloud Atlas enough to try something from earlier...number9dream is the story of Eiji Miyake: a twenty year old Japanese lad from Yukashima who has arrived in Tokyo with the intention (or you might say dream) of meeting his father. Eiji is an effective orphan. His mother is a absent and his father is completely unknown. Instead he grew up with his extended family and his sister, Anju. We follow Eiji throughout his entire time in Tokyo, tracking his father down, getting into scrapes with the local Yakuza (some of the Yakuza storylines felt a little bit over the top and convenient), falling for a girl; through to meeting his father, realising his father's a bit of a dick and he's better off without him, and reconciling with his mother. These aren't really spoilers, because the outcome of the story isn't the point. The point is the journey and the form.Because what's immediately apparent is that Cloud Atlas wasn't a one-off. Mitchell has always been the kind of author who delights in letting us know that he's clever enough to be able to fuck about with conventional story-telling narrative techniques. Making it clear that he refuses to be trapped by, or conform to, our simplistic notions of how a story should be. He is better than that. His use of form is all \u2013 even if the story suffers. Not so much unreliable narrator as unreliable author. But, to give him his due, it is pretty clever \u2013 he even manages to get the title to his later novel Cloud Atlas into this book. You just start to wonder if clever is all he's got.Each of the nine chapters is marked with an icon to represent it. An empty square, a diamond of four smaller contiguous diamonds, the astrological symbols for cancer and leo, the Japanese characters \u56de\u5929 (Kai Ten), etc. Some seem to be tightly tied to the events in that chapter, others less so. Each chapter has two narratives running through it. The main narrative is the story of Eiji, the secondary narrative is the 'dream': a series of fantasy alternative events, flashbacks to his childhood with his sister Anju, a video game, a series of short stories he's reading, diary entries, etc. Again, some of them integrate well, others feel more like Mitchell was just searching for a second narrative. As the chapter switches between the two narratives they are coded with the chapter's icon or a solid diamond. This feels quite structured at first, but kind of becomes less rigid as the book progresses \u2013 almost like Mitchell kind of forgot why he was doing it and got bored. Then, ultimately, the book comes full circle as Eiji realises that a minor event at the start of the novel has become key to the completion of the end.The ninth chapter is empty. Like those pages in technical manuals that say \"this page left deliberately blank\". This is explained by Lennon himself, in one of the 'dream' narratives, because \"The ninth dream begins after every ending.\"."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76881-tara", "userReview": "number9dream was nearly as awesome as  cloud atlas--and still a 5 star novel. this book demonstrates one of the things i love most about mitchell--his ability to write in a number of different voices convincingly within the same novel (hardboiled/cyberpunk/actiony, the weird and whimsical goatwriter stories, the diary of a japanese soldier in WW2), which he accomplishes here without sacrificing the clarity and honesty of his narrator's voice. eiji miyake is one of the most likeable protagonists i've ever met!! i love how mitchell messes around with fantasy/dreamery/memory/fiction/reality, so much that in the end i still can't necessarily sort out what was really \"real.\" eiji starts out as a self-consciously unreliable narrator, tacitly admitting he's led the reader on by presenting his fantasies as fact. but in the end, it's unclear whether he might be the subject of someone else's fantasy... he acknowledges that he's imagined himself to be the dream of the real eiji miyake... but does acknowledging that make it untrue?? once you realize you're dreaming, is it still a dream? the dream/fiction/fantasy sequences are laced with double-edged clues about imagination and reality (\"How do you smuggle daydreams into reality?\" \"My imagination is my worst enemy--no, that is not true, but the comfort it gives me is never warmer than tepid.\") ... i sensed even more crazy existential shit lurking beneath the surface (the lost property office? anyone?) but i can't figure it out without going all High School English right now, and i stopped reading this book with a pen after page 50 or so because it was just getting too insane.much has been made of the comparison between mitchell and murakami, particularly in this book (#9 Dream/Norweigian Wood, etc.), and people have pegged it as \"murakami lite\" or a \"murakami wannabe\" sort of thing. i tend to like mitchell's books MORE than murakami--it's like, similar themes, but less abstruse and oppressive. i also think mitchell's writing style is so much more colorful and pleasing than murakami's, down to individual words. my boat is particularly floated by \"mandolineering gondoliers\" and \"zombie spawn abseil to earth\" (the NYT calls mitchell's prose \"comically overripe\"--but funnily enough, that review is titled \"Zombie Spawn Descend to Earth\"...) and i was totally tickled by the linguistic-schtick in the goatwriter tales: \"I daresay you had another writing dream, sir, like the time you dreamed you wrote Les Miserables.

How colossally it fucked with my mind. During the first chapter I was thinking \"I'll be damned if I have a clue what's going on\". The rating I had in mind was in the two-star territory until halfway through. It's not that it was bad, but after Ghostwritten, it wasn't what I expected. For the next few chapters, an additional star made its appearance and then the final chapter happened to me. You read right. It's not so much that you read number9dream as it is it \"happens\" to you.Mitchell's prose is like a thick liquid made by substances of all kinds. At times, I caught myself reading a sentence again and again either to properly suck in the lyrical, almost poetic, flow of words or to experience again and again the clever, scratch that, the brilliant meanings hidden behind. Number9dream is full of proverb-like witticisms and word-games such as \"Could my quixotic quest be a quite quotidian query?\". And it's not just the prose but also the dialogs with the top moment being when Eiji (that is, our protagonist), in a dream, asks John Lennon what Tomorrow Never Knows is about and John says \"I never knew\". \"But you wrote it\", says Eiji and John answers: \"No, it wrote me.\" Number9dream is often satirical. With all the action-packed scenes and Yakuza references, it seems to make fun of a whole genre of books. But the true essence of the book is dreams. Dreams serve as a means of communication between Eiji and himself as much as between Mitchell and the reader. Careful and quality depictions of dreams in book and movies always hit a soft spot in me and this is no exception. And as if this wasn't enough, Mitchell throws in dozens of musical references, especially of John Lennon and his songs, as well as Murakami references whom obviously he's been greatly influenced by.I could go on and on about the dozens of threads that constitute this novel but I have neither the patience nor the eloquence to do them justice.

In outward form, number9dream is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses\u2014through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck\u2014a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father\u2019s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.", "title": "number9dream", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6820.number9dream", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320540682l/6820.jpg", "reviews": 1387, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6538289.David_Mitchell", "name": "David Mitchell"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Fantasy", "Magical Realism", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6820.number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/975186.number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823826.number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6699275-number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212845.number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297085-number9dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20819685-the-bone-clocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24499258-slade-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14316.Black_Swan_Green", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
