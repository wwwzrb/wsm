I FUCKING LOVE NOAH.AND I FUCKING LOVE KATIE McGARRY! I have officially read this only about, OH, a MILLION times. How do you get sick of a book that draws you in from the first page every single time. There's so many different views of this book it's like reading a new story each and every time I read it. 'His lips curved into a sexy smile and I became lost in him. \u201cI love you, Echo Emerson.\u201dI whispered the words as he brought his lips to mine. \u201cForever.\u201d'This book is just, there's no words. It's so friggin awesome, I am going to have to worship it.No-one can possibly understand how obsessed I am with this whole story!I have been waiting to read this for months, and boy was it worth the wait.  \"\u201cI\u2019M BUYING YOU A COAT.\u201d And I meant it. I opened the car door and slung my leather jacket around her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s February. Why don\u2019t you ever have a damn jacket on?\u201dEcho slid her arms through my coat, closing her eyes as she inhaled. When she finally opened them, she fluttered her eyelashes, giving me a look of pure seduction. \u201cMaybe I like wearing yours instead.\u201dI swallowed. I had plans, and those plans did not involve kissing her against my car. Dammit, she was going to kill me. \u201cCongratulations, it\u2019s yours.\u201dHer laughter warmed me in ways a jacket couldn\u2019t. \u201cAre you going to be a big pushover now?\u201dAppeared so. I entwined my fingers with Echo\u2019s and walked her across the empty street, toward the fountain. Red and pink lights lit up the water trickling from the three flowered tiers.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Echo stared at the fountain, her eyes darting to the different flowers etched in the metal. No, she was beautiful. Noah is just, AHHHH The things I would do to himHe is just so damn attractive. He may as well put a collar and lead on me because I would be his 'pet' anyday! Echo is just amazing. Sarcastic, gorgeous and feisty. She and me were besties from the first sentence. Amazing heroin. People would constantly be asking her if she was 'ok', and instead of lying and saying 'fine' like the other millions of people out there she says this: \u201cMy father is a control freak, I hate my stepmother, my brother is dead and my mother has \u2026 well \u2026 issues. How do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201dI laughed and I knew I was going to love every minute of this book. I love the way the author split Noah and Echo's POV's. They were perfectly timed.So well written and addictive. Theres so much more I could say about this book, but right now I'm like a drug addict and this book is my crack. I've spent too long writing this and now I'm shaking to get back and quite possibly read it all over again. I know it's only come out today but damn I'd have to advise you to drop whatever it is your reading and start with this because my friggin god you will not be able to PUT IT DOWN. The story that lies in between the covers are sad, emotional, lovely, sweet, romantic and breathtakingly heartwarming. My heart aches and grieves for both Noah and Echo, whom have lived such hard and sad lives and have had to grow up so fast and make descisions people as young as themselves shouldn't have to make. Hell their my age and I don't know what I would have done in their positions. They are so admirable and anyone would be lucky to have them as role models. Their strong, loyal, honest and good people who just needed guidance and Mrs Collins was there supporting them the whole way through she never gave up. My god, I loved this. I can't tell you how much I love this. There's not one bad point I can think of. And that NEVER happens. Not to me. I'm so fussy and will pick over the littlest things. But this is the exception. And I wouldn't have it any other way.Un-freakin-believable- that's the first word that came to mind when I finished this. This book blew me away and this has definitely barged its way into my top 10. This book is worth 5 big fat stars and I am now going to go and make it known to everyone about how much they should read it.Here's some More of my favorite parts; My song ended, my finger stopped tapping the beat, and we ceased swaying from side to side. She held perfectly still, keeping her hand in mine, her head resting on my shoulder. I nuzzled into the warmth of her silky curls, tightening my hold on her. Echo was becoming essential, like air.She opened her mouth, her tongue seductively touching mine, almost bringing me to my knees. Flames licked through me as our kiss deepened. Her hands massaged my scalp and neck, only stoking the heat of the fire.\u201cBecause,\u201d I said as I felt the familiar twisting in my stomach. \u201cYou saw me lose it. You saw me almost go insane.\u201dThe muscles in his shoulders visibly tensed. \u201cI watched you battle against the worst memory of your life and I watched you win. Make no mistake, Echo. I battled right beside you. You need to find some trust in me \u2026 in us.\u201dNoah inhaled and slowly let the air out. His stance softened and so did his voice. \u201cIf you\u2019re scared, tell me. If you need to cry and scream, then do it. And you sure as hell don\u2019t walk away from us because you think it would be better for me. Here\u2019s the reality, Echo: I want to be by your side. If you want to go to the mall stark naked so you can show the world your scars, then let me hold your hand. If you want to see your mom, then tell me that, too. I may not always understand, but damn, baby, I\u2019ll try.\u201dI stared at him and he stared at me.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t get better,\u201d I said. \u201cThe pain. The wounds scab over and you don\u2019t always feel like a knife is slashing through you. But when you least expect it, the pain flashes to remind you you\u2019ll never be the same.\u201dThis book is just so intensely real.

Her mother was beautiful, and had every talent known to a paintbrush.Just like Echo.But Echo doesn\u2019t remember that night two years ago. She doesn\u2019t remember her mother trying to kill her, and the last time she tried to recall those memories; she landed in the hospital due to mental trauma for trying to force her mind to bring up something it was trying desperately to repress.\nHer dad knows what happened. Her step-mother knows what happened.Even Echo\u2019s highschool counselor knows what happened.But no one\u2019s fessing up. Everyone wants Echo to remember on her own. So without those memories, Echo sticks to the facts:\u2022\tHer mother  did  try to kill her, and she has the physical scars to prove it.\u2022\tShe\u2019s now the school freakshow.\u2022\tHer father cheated on her mother with Echo\u2019s baby-sitter.\u2022\tHer best friend of an older brother is dead.\u2022\tAnd she\u2019s falling fast and hard for someone who she should stay the hell away from.\u2665 \n Noah \n \u2665\n\n This was Noah Hutchins. The Noah Hutchins that refused steady relationships or even dating. The Noah Hutchins that only wanted one-night stands. A stoner. My opposite. And right now, everything I wanted. \nHis past went up in flames. Literally. And it took his parents along with it, leaving him with nothing but once-a-month visitation rights to his younger brothers.And Noah would give anything to have his brothers back. But when you\u2019re a teenager thrown into the foster system\u2026 it\u2019s hard to live life on the straight and narrow.It doesn\u2019t matter that he was once at the top of his class. It doesn\u2019t matter that he was an MVP on the basketball team. It doesn\u2019t matter that at one time in his life, smiling was once just a reflex kind of thing.All he has now are girls who only seem to remember his name when they\u2019re moaning it; a family who consists of two friends he would do anything for; an annoying high school counselor who for some unknown fucking reason, believes in him; two younger brothers with smiles that he would literally move heaven and hell for; and\u2026An irritatingly gorgeous red-head tutor who has scars on the outside that perfectly match the ones he carries on the inside.And despite everything, Noah can\u2019t help falling in love with her.\n\n Soon the pen she held in her hand drummed in time with her foot. I understood her rhythm. That feeling of everything inside twisting to the point that if you didn\u2019t find a release you\u2019d explode. I craved to grant her peace. \n\n\nI wanted to blow her mind with every touch and every kiss so her very thought always came back to me. I would never touch anyone else again without thinking about her. \nBut sometimes\u2026No matter how hard you try to fix someone;No matter how hard you fight their demons;No matter how hard you guard their sleep;\nYou can\u2019t."}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "Normal. She wanted normal and so did I.\n\nIf I could summarize this book with one (okay, technically two) sentence, that would be the one. Nothing else needs to be said. You can figure out from one simple sentence that this is a book about two people who have lost everything and are trying to figure out how to get normalcy back in their lives. 3.25 stars. If I was judging Pushing the Limits solely based on the journey of the characters and how they struggled to reach their own personal victories, I would have gone 4 stars on the book. This was a great story. I like to see characters with depth and grit. It's always fascinating to watch people push past their inner demons and come out on the other side to start their healing process. Both Noah and Echo were inspirational characters who learned not only how to work on themselves, but also learned how to encourage each other to trust again.What lost me (just a little) was the execution.There were several trigger words and generalizations which had me cringing :1. The over-use of nicknames, such as baby, siren, goddess, nymph, etc., as well as the always-sure-to-cause-an-eye-roll note of likening another person's presence to a drug. As well, the mention of Echo smelling like cinnamon was excessive after about the third time. She smells like a bakery. I got it. 2. Stating that foster kids and kids from bad homes lay low for a reason (this is a stereotype that isn't always true - I've known kids from foster homes and bad homes who were popular and good students). Statements like this always seem to make me want to cue the dramatic music in my head because these appear to be written for the purpose of trying to invoke a feeling which isn't always necessary.3. Assuming that someone is on a bad path because they smoke weed or drink socially, and therefore that person needs to expel this from their life immediately, otherwise their entire future is in danger. Well crap...I feel bad for more than 50% of today's teens then. They're all screwed. It's a wonder I have such a productive life today, being a former weed smoker and social drinker.4. Using the word \"forever\" to describe a fledgling relationship. Did Judy Blume teach us nothing? This is HIGH SCHOOL. Yes, some people meet their spouses in high school... but I hate when books want to predict futures which aren't necessarily predictable. Anything can happen after high school. We don't need to tie these kids down beyond possibly continuing the relationship into college. Not unless you're going to do a Perfect Chemistry epilogue where it shows them married years down the line (and believe me, I could live without those).What really did shine about this book :1. The characters. Both Echo and Noah were smart and cautious about many things. Echo was a great example of showing how it's okay not to have sex if you're not ready. Noah was a great example of how a teenage guy can be horny and hormonal and wanting to get laid, yet still respectful of a girl's wishes if he cares about her. His honesty was refreshing. He didn't stop wanting sex, even though he let Echo have her space when she needed it.\n\nHer beautiful breasts were right there for me to see, but I wanted to do more than observe, I wanted to...\n\n2. As mentioned earlier, the story. Other than it being a little on the long side and having a few moments I could have lived without, I enjoyed the read. The story did have a few similarities to Perfect Chemistry but wasn't an exact mirror either, so I wasn't bothered by it. The problems of the main characters in Pushing were not gang related, yet the problems were still just as emotional and tough as what Alex and Brittany had to go through in PC. Overall, I think this would be a good read for people who are huge fans of love conquering the greatest of problems.\n\n\"I watched you battle against the worst memory of your life and I watched you win. Make no mistake, Echo. I battled right beside you.\""}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "When I rate a book three stars, it usually means indifference, that the book was neither especially good or bad. That I probably won't even remember it in a few days time. With Pushing the Limits that is not the case, it's more that I feel the positives and negatives equally balance each other out and the overall book falls somewhere in the middle of the rating scale because of it. I will say, though, the issues that I felt sure I'd have with it were not the reason I gave it such an average rating.I approached this young adult romance with the caution I always approach young adult romance novels with. Plus an extra shot of it because of the bad boy/good girl cliche we are promised. As far as these types of cliched stories go, I'd say Pushing the Limits is one of the best and is far better than those of Simone Elkeles. I personally think McGarry has written a great debut and the novel would have fully achieved excellence had she not played in the safe zone and used the same old format and character types. Everything was a little too predictable. However, I see enough promise here to want to try her next novel - Dare You To - and see if Beth's story can avoid the same mistakes (based on her character, I think it might).So... bad boys. Just a few years ago, I wouldn't have hesitated to say that I love a bad boy. The kind of man who promises a wild adventure with his smile, and exciting sexcapades with a raise of his eyebrow. But the definition of this sexy creature has changed, or perhaps it was always the same and I just didn't notice it as much... but either way, a \"bad boy\" is now someone like Patch Cipriano from Hush, Hush and others like him, men or boys who push women around, attempt to control them, become violent when they don't get their own way. Noah Hutchins is nothing like that. Noah is what I mean when I say \"bad boy\", he is fun and likes to break a few rules, but he always respects Echo's wishes, he is kind to her and - you won't believe it - actually leaves her alone when she metaphorically gives him the finger.To get down to the real problem, it is quite simply: the angst. McGarry is a good enough author to realise that she needs to give her characters issues and imperfections (especially if they're going to be of the cliche variety). But I didn't think the execution of either character dealing with their problems was done well, it felt a bit messy, a lot melodramatic, and it was all wrapped up in what I felt was a rather unsatisfactory way. I also think the sizzling chemistry quickly gave way to the usual romantic natterings of the deeply forever in luuurrrve. Don't get me wrong, I wanted Echo and Noah to be together right up to the last minute, but I would have preferred a little less \"I love you more than anything in the world, baby\". There's only so many times calling someone \"baby\" is cute.In the end, this book had two characters with amazing chemistry who I genuinely cared about. They were flawed and interesting, but there was too much doom, gloom and angsting going on. Some parts were sad until I passed through the sadness and into eye-rolling territory. I feel conflicted about the novel as a whole, but I do believe in the author's potential. Let's see where she goes from here."}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "4.5 starsA heart-wrenching YA book about two broken teens struggling to put the shattered pieces of their lives back together and finding love along the way.  \u201cHer shoulders never shook. No tears streamed down her face. The worst type of crying wasn\u2019t the kind everyone could see\u2013the wailing on street corners, the tearing at clothes. No, the worst kind happened when your soul wept and no matter what you did, there was no way to comfort it. A section withered and became a scar on the part of your soul that survived. For people like me and Echo, our souls contained more scar tissue than life.\u201d  From the first line of this book, I was drawn right into Echo\u2019s world. With a mentally ill mother, an overly controlling father, and her beloved older brother dead, Echo\u2019s life is far from perfect. Its stifling. And you can totally feel it. The story just grabs at your heart strings.Noah was an amazing character. He\u2019s a bad boy, but only on the outside. He seems to be that way because that\u2019s what everyone in his life labels him as. A stoner, one-night-stand player, under achiever\u2026 thats how the world sees him. But no one sees what led him to become this way. To the depths of his pain and the tragedy of the events in his life. \u201c \u2026I could tell he was looking at me. The stubble on his face moved as he smiled. Noah had muscles, looks, and trouble stalking him. Somehow he made jeans and a t-shirt look dangerous. Not that I was into girl-using stoners. Yet, I took another peek at him while sipping my drink.\u201d He really stole my heart \u2013 like all the way! His parents died in an accident a few years back and he and his little brothers were put into the foster system and separated and now he is fighting to get them out of the system and to put whats left of his family back together. Every SINGLE one of his scenes with his little brothers made my cry (a lot) and just made my heart ache with wanting them to be happy.Both Noah and Echo are intensely angry and miserable in their lives, honestly it was hard to say which one made my heart break more at times. This book is so well written that you understand their frustrations and anger at the systems and rules which are screwing up their lives as though they were your own.The book is told in alternating POVs with serves to show how different the worlds they come from are. The romantic relationship in this book builds slowly. Its not an undeniable- love-at-first-sight-instant-relationship kind of book. The personal journeys of the characters are the main focus of the storyline although they do end up together Both of them have been betrayed by life, and watching them learn to trust each other was really sweet.  \u201cIf you\u2019re scared, tell me. If you need to cry and scream, then do it. And you sure as hell don\u2019t walk away from us because you think it would be better for me. Here\u2019s the reality, Echo: I want to be by your side. If you want to go to the mall stark naked so you can show the world your scars, then let me hold your hand. If you want to see your mom, then tell me that too. I may not always understand, but damn, baby, I\u2019ll try.\u201d  The issues this book deals with are very serious. Abuse. Neglect. Truth. Lies. Love. Healing. The intensity of the bond between siblings. There is nothing lighthearted about this book. Its deeply, gut-wrenchingly emotional. As I was reading, I\u2019d literally have to take mini breathers to calm my heart between some of the scenes. \u201dTell me you chose me, Echo.\u201d\u2026\u201cI chose you.\u201d\u2026\u201cYou will never regret it. I promise.\u201d I think fans of Slammed might like this book. It\u2019s by no means the same storyline, but it shares a similar feeling. Although its more 'tame'\u2026 very strongly YA.There were a few things that bugged me a little about the book. Echo\u2019s reliance on her \u2018popular\u2019 friends at school and her need for their approval didn\u2019t really sit right with me\u2026 but at the same time, I guess it was an understandable feeling for someone in high school. I just wish it hadn\u2019t been so important to her\u2026. And I also would have wished for an epilogue. The book has a happy-for-now ending (and a sequel featuring some of the secondary characters on the way) but after all the heart ache in the book, I still would have liked a glimpse maybe 5 years into the future so see how things had worked out for them.All in all though, I really loved this read\u2026 if you are looking for a new YA book, this is it!How I see Noah and Echo:For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "When try\u00ading to find a way to describe this book \u2013 I set\u00adtled on this: Push\u00ading The Lim\u00adits is the clos\u00adest I\u2019ve ever got\u00adten to read\u00ading a Machetta book.For any\u00adone famil\u00adiar with me or Machetta \u2013 that is the high\u00adest praise I give.Very rarely does a book make me laugh and cry at all \u2013 let alone mul\u00adti\u00adple times. But that\u2019s what this book did. And really, what the hell kind of badass reviewer am I when I\u2019m brought to snivel\u00ading, snotty tears by a book? Noah and Echo don\u2019t talk at school. Noah is the atyp\u00adi\u00adcal bad boy and Echo is the for\u00admer Teen Queen on the verge of reclaim\u00ading her for\u00admer glory. But Noah and Echo have a lot more in com\u00admon than they real\u00adize. They\u2019re both bro\u00adken. This book is told through both of their view points as they start ther\u00adapy and their lives start to unravel and they get pushed closer and closer together by their circumstances.What I love is that there are three real\u00adi\u00adties in this book. McGarry takes into account that there is Noah\u2019s truth, Echo\u2019s truth and then there\u2019s this whole other crea\u00adture we\u2019ll call What Is Actu\u00adally Hap\u00adpen\u00ading. I haven\u2019t seen some\u00adone show flawed nar\u00adra\u00adtion this well in a long time. What McGarry cap\u00adtured per\u00adfectly is that dis\u00adcon\u00adnect while keep\u00ading me plugged in an sympathetic.Exam\u00adple.Noah is fight\u00ading for cus\u00adtody of his younger broth\u00aders. When his par\u00adents died, he and his sib\u00adlings were sep\u00ada\u00adrated. Noah was placed in a series of very bad and neg\u00adli\u00adgent homes while his broth\u00aders were placed with a cus\u00adtody fam\u00adily who restrict his access to his sib\u00adlings and are try\u00ading to adopt them.Echo\u2019s father and his new wife (Echo\u2019s old babysit\u00adter) have a very rocky, unhealthy rela\u00adtion\u00adship. He is con\u00adtrol\u00adling, the new wife is preg\u00adnant and Echo is des\u00adper\u00adate to try and make con\u00adtact with her mother (who has been cut off from con\u00adtact by Echo\u2019s father).At least \u2013 that is how it looks at the begin\u00adning. And it\u2019s very easy to think that these adults in Echo and Noah\u2019s lives are hor\u00adri\u00adble. But whilst Echo and Noah con\u00adtinue to see them that way for awhile, and whilst I as the reader remained com\u00adpletely empa\u00adthetic as to why Noah and Echo saw them that way, it becomes clear that the sit\u00adu\u00ada\u00adtion is not as cut and dry as that.By the cli\u00admax of both Echo and Noah\u2019s sto\u00adries I was weep\u00ading uncon\u00adtrol\u00adlably. I still cry when I think about those two parts of the book. McGarry\u2019s writ\u00ading is pow\u00ader\u00adful, emo\u00adtive. Her char\u00adac\u00adter voices for both Noah and Echo were very well done \u2013 reflect\u00ading on their dis\u00adtinct per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adi\u00adties and char\u00adac\u00adter\u00adis\u00adtics. The plot con\u00adtained lit\u00adtle action and was largely car\u00adried by the myr\u00adiad of rela\u00adtion\u00adships and the mys\u00adtery of Echo\u2019s past \u2013 so fans of more fast paced, active nov\u00adels may want to steer clear.Mrs Collins, their ther\u00ada\u00adpist, plays an almost omnipo\u00adtent, god\u00adlike char\u00adac\u00adter in the novel and brought a fresh, lov\u00adable addi\u00adtion.

I loved this so hard! Echo and Noah\u2026 Echo. Noah. Nocho?Echo has been through an extremely distressing, life altering ordeal because of which she's suffering post-traumatic stress, with the worst side effect being memory loss. She doesn't remember what happened. All she has are the scars. From popular to outsider, Echo's troubled state-of-mind is harsh and unstable. One of the best character development I've read, she made me a part of her. With only the span of a few pages, she had me immersed in her world, in her heart and soul. Every layer of her being is gradually being laid out for us to become equally mesmerized and perplexed by. Her scars, her babysitter-turned-stepmother, her dead brother, along with her PTSD, she has the world on her shoulders and I was right there alongside her, sharing the weight. With an equally burdened soul, Noah only wants two things: Jacob, and Tyler. After his parents died in a fire, the three brothers have been in the foster system and Noah wants nothing more than his family back together. The emotions in his perspective begin from our very first glance into his melancholy life. His relationship with his brothers brought tears to my eyes, pulling me in wholeheartedly. He may be tortured and angry - the perfect bad boy image -, yet, underneath his tough exterior he's a loving, caring person who would move heaven and earth for those boys, and, eventually, for Echo. This is a wonderful example of a perfectly woven dual perspective. Both characters are highly vivid, evoking powerful emotions that truly connect the reader to each character. Sketching them one page at a time. Romantic. Passionate. Frustrating. Filled to the brink with chemistry. The love story in Pushing the Limits is raw. This is true love at its purest form, with sacrifices and compromises, incredible obstacles, and learning to trust without holding back. Like true love, it's not easy, and it's not always painless. We're dealing with two damaged individuals who need to find themselves before they let themselves find each other. Covering a lot more ground than the love story itself, we get intense, emotional ups and downs that just about gave me heart palpitations. While reading, I quickly lost myself in this incredibly enchanting story, experiencing a multitude of complex emotions. By the time I put this book down, I had a heavy heart and a set smile. Combining love and loss, friendship and family, the unfairnesses of life and the determination to overcome them, Pushing the Limits is a book that is not only to be read, but cherished. This is one gem that shines!--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Reynje", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5590906-reynje", "userReview": "2.5 starsPart way through Pushing The Limits, I put down my kindle and thought: Am I (gasp) too old crotchety and cynical for this? I wanted to like this book, but ultimately I just ended up feeling like I\u2019d been caught in a stampede of drama llamas. Contemporary YA is probably my favourite genre. And I like books that challenge me emotionally. But while I had no real problem with Noah and Echo\u2019s respective Issues-with-a-capital\u201dI\u201d, something about this just felt off to me. It didn\u2019t feel sincere, and therefore it didn\u2019t resonate with me. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 McGarry\u2019s characters have valid, realistic obstacles and conflicts to contend with. It was just something about the execution that didn\u2019t work for me. It felt too overwrought, too obvious, too overwhelmingly angsty for me to really engage with the story. The treatment of several of the (abundant) issues fell flat for me \u2013 it read more like an grab for an emotional reaction than a really nuanced discussion of serious topics like mental illness and abuse. On a scale of Elkeles (Chain Reaction) to Echols (Going Too Far), Pushing The Limits falls somewhere in the middle for me. There\u2019s probably a time when I would have adored this book, and I can honestly see why others love it, but it was a problematic book for me on a few levels. The lack of subtlety for one (which is probably just a personal taste thing), and the reliance on over-used clich\u00e9s for another. I feel like I\u2019ve met all of these characters before, I\u2019ve heard the same bad-boy meets former popular girl angst too many times before. (Also, Noah\u2019s repeated use of expressions like \u201csiren\u201d, \u201cnymph\u201d and \u201cseductress\u201d produced more snort-laughs than swoons from me. For example:\"A ghost of that siren smile graced her lips as she tilted her head closer to mine, creating the undeniable pull of the sailor lost at sea to the beautiful goddess calling him home.\" If that quote just made you melt, go read this book immediately. However if, like me, you just stifled a pterodactyl-like screech of hysteria, this book might not really set your loins on fire. )Definitely recommended for fans of Perfect Chemistry. Just not really my thing, unfortunately."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "WHAT DID I JUST READ??????????\nStunning! Pushing the Limits was pure awesomeness! I loved McGarry\u2019s writing style! I loved the story! I loved the main characters and their development! I loved it all....sigh! Katie McGarry has written an emotionally charged book about two broken and troubled teens, Echo and Noah, who find comfort in each other as their worlds continue to shatter around them. It is the most heart-wrenching (and heart-warming) of romances, wrapped in a poignant tale of family, friends and acceptance while coated with bittersweet humour. \n\"Normal. She wanted normal and so did I.\"\nThis book is about the journey that the main characters take and how they struggle to reach their own personal victories (essentially, find their \u201cnormal\u201d). Both Noah and Echo were amazing characters who learned not only how to work on themselves, but also learned how to encourage each other to trust again. Echo is this beautiful and lost girl who simply wants her old life back (or so she thinks). It was simply wonderful watching her push past her limitations, grow past her hurt and anger, stand up for herself and discovering herself again. Noah likes to portray an image that he is the quintessential bad boy; however, underneath that fa\u00e7ade is a young man who is hurting and trying to make things right for his family. He loves his brothers with everything he has got. Noah and his little brothers broke my heart. What they went through was incomprehensible. Noah desperately yearns to give his little brothers the security his family once had. This is so difficult for someone his age. You can't help but empathize with his feelings of helplessness. Both our protagonists have a long journey ahead of them in this book and, for me, that was the greatest part of McGarry\u2019s storyline. I love a great coming of age story and this one did not disappoint.I loved the development of the relationship between Noah and Echo \u2013 it simply flowed and was organic. There was no rushing into love with these two. Pushing the Limits is a deeper story about two lost souls becoming whole within themselves and finding healing in themselves. There is such a rawness to their love story. Noah and Echo both came to the understanding that loving someone often means compromise and it sometimes means that you have to put the other person\u2019s needs/wants before your own. The author does not paint a simple happily-ever-after fairytale, instead she tells a tale showing a gradual path to forgiveness and acceptance. It\u2019s a journey.One of the elements to this storyline that I had a hard time with was a lot of the secondary characters. Goodness, did I LOATHE them! There were so many times I found myself getting worked up over Echo's dickhead father or her so called \"friends\" at school. Often times, when I despise characters enough, it can ruin a book for me. This did not happen with Pushing the Limits. There was a turning point for me. I realized that there are silly high school clicks that truly behave as Echo's friends did. And, well, her father, he did what he did. It was not right; however, we all make mistakes in life. I managed to accept this and move on. Can't say I completely forgave Echo's father, but there was an acceptance. I can\u2019t say enough about this book. It is simply a gorgeous debut novel by Katie McGarry. I am looking forward to Beth\u2019s story which I believe is coming out some time next year. I am expecting another poignant novel by this author.*************Some of my favourite quotes are:\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, tell me. If you need to cry and scream, then do it. And you sure as hell don\u2019t walk away from us because you think it would be better for me. Here\u2019s the reality, Echo: I want to be by your side. If you want to go to the mall stark naked so you can show the world your scars, then let me hold your hand. If you want to see your mom, then tell me that too. I may not always understand, but damn, baby, I\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cI watched you battle against the worst memory of your life and I watched you win. Make no mistake, Echo. I battled right beside you.\u201d\u201cHer eyes met mine again. \u201cSo what does this mean for us?\u201dI lowered my forehead to hers. \u201cIt means you\u2019re mine.\u201d\u201cLuke used to give me butterflies.

Seventeen year-old Echo Emerson used to be part of the popular crowd. Two years ago things changed. Her parents divorced, her babysitter became her step-mother, and her older brother Aires died in combat. But this is not the event that changed everything for Echo. Two years ago, an event she can't remember resulted in her waking up in the hospital two-days later, with injuries up and down both her arms. Injuries that left her with ugly scars, and a restraining order in place against her mother. Because of the \"event\" Echo has been mandated by the State to attend therapy sessions. She has just been assigned a new therapist, one that she shares with Noah Hutchins, resident bad-boy with a reputation of one-night-stands. Noah Hutchins has his own set of problems. Two and half years ago, he was on the honor-roll, competed in sports, and had the perfect family. Two loving parents and two-younger brothers. This was before his parents were killed in a house fire. Now Noah is separated from his little brothers. He's in one foster home, while they are in another. Noah's dream is to get his brothers back and reunite what's left of his family. He's had a string of bad luck with the homes he's been placed in. This is why he is now in court mandated therapy sessions, and on limited visitation with his younger brothers. Echo and Noah's worlds collide when Echo is assigned to tutor Noah. These two don't immediately hit it off. At first they really don't care for each other but a common goal presents itself, and they unite. Noah and Echo didn't realize they had so much in common. What follows, is a common bond over their tragedies and a growing attraction! I was just gaga over this romance! There is heat and tension but also understanding and empathy. Noah and Echo start to truly care for one another. There were so many scenes of swoon! Weak-in-the-knees swoon! You know me, I have to share a little of at least one! Here you go: \n* \"Keep it up Echo. I'm all about foreplay.\" She laughed so loudly, she slapped a hand over her mouth, yet the giggles escaped. \"You are so full of yourself. You think because girls swoon over you and let you into their pants on the first try that I'll follow suit. Think again. Besides, I have your number now. Every time you try to look all dark and dangerous, I'll picture you wearing a pink striped polo, collar up, and a pair of pleated chinos.\" No way. I stalked over to Echo, feeling like a tiger after its prey. She backed up against the wall, but I kept up my approach. I pressed against her, feeling each sensual curve. I wanted to touch every inch of her body. Her sweet smell intoxicated me. Her eyes kept her laughter, but her smile faded as she bit her lower lip. Damn, did she have any idea what she was doing? For a girl hell-bent on keeping me away, she sure did everything to turn me on. \nThere is a mystery behind Echo's injuries that is gradually revealed to her. What we find out is so heartbreaking and INFURIATING at the same time. BE WARNED, you are going to HATE Echo's parents and the self-centered step-mother, Ashley!! The father constantly put Ashley before Echo, even when she desperately needed him! I was overjoyed when Echo started standing up to her father and told him things he needed to hear! Don't even get me started on the mother. Still, I think the parents got off way too easy in my opinion! Trust me, you are going to shake a fist or two while reading this story because of them! Ms. McGarry did an excellent job writing these awful people. Noah and his little brothers touched my heart! What they lost and its consequences was heart-wrenching. Noah loves his brothers. He yearns to give them the security his family once had. This is so difficult for someone his age. You can't help but empathize with his feelings of helplessness. I must congratulate Katie McGarry on her wonderful ability to make me care so much for these characters. It's so important to me that I connect with the main characters in a story, and she really made that happen. I highly recommend this story! I thought it was an amazing debut for Ms. McGarry, and I'll be reading anything else she decides to write! *Quote is taken from uncorrected ARC.

After her sudden absence at the end of her sophomore year Echo was never the same. Of course the rumor mill takes over and becomes out of control by the time she starts Junior year. However the truth is only known by a few. And unfortunately Echo is not one of them. Her memory of what happened to alter her life and leave her arms badly scarred is suppressed. Bummer right? The doctors all say it will come back when she is ready to handle it. Now Echo is forced to see her school shrink Mrs. Collins. Things change for Echo after she cross paths with Noah Hutchins. Noah is the school loner who has a rep for one night stands and getting high off weed. After butting heads the two realize they share a common need. And that is to read their case files for information. Information they both are not allowed to have yet crave more than their next breath. Of course they soon start to crave each other as well.Reading about these two made me feel like i was coming in to contact with static electricity.

For people like me and Echo, our souls contained more scar tissue than life.' - Noah's inner monologueSeriously.. Read this book! Fave lines\"Stop sulking already. If you would have screwed her when you first met her, like i told you to, you wouldn't be twisted like a damn pretzel.\" -Beth\"I'll always save you.\" Because i would. I'd move heaven and earth.

I'd give up anything and everything for him. -Noah\"Come here, baby.\" And with my words, Echo leaned into me: soft, pliant, broken. \"You're not alone.\" I whispered into her hair as i cradled her in my arms. \"You're not alone because you have me.\" -NoahThoughtsThis book is unputdownable!

But when she did it was AMAZING. I hated how she allowed herself to be treated unfair by that BITCH Grace. And I hate the social class placed on kids in school and i hate hate hate followers. I loved her and Noah's relationship how they connected and shared their fears, struggles and goals with each other. I hope to get glimpses of her and Noah together in Beth's book.Noah- What is their not to love about him. His strength and his love was so beautiful. It made him even more sexier if thats possible. He took no crap what so ever when it came to his friends and family. The guy exudes AWESOMENESS! He was also FEARLESS he had no qualms with taking on the system and fighting for what he believed. He also possessed GRACE when it came to accepting what he knew in his heart was right.Lila- I liked Lila she proved to be a good friend. True she had her moments. But she never turned her back on Echo unlike some...Mrs. Collins I loved her. I love how she really cared for both Echo and Noah. She championed for them and never let them down not once.

It is such a sweet and emotional book. Actually my kind of book. I love troubled (but not angsty and annoying) main characters because it challenges me to dig deeper into their past and understand why they become what they are. The story centers on Noah Hutchins-- a guy who became an orphan at a very early age because of the accident that happened to his family several years ago, and Echo Emerson-- a girl who suffers a memory suppression because of the freaky incident that happened to her and her mom. Both of them share a couple of subjects together at school but they never had a chance to be good friends until their new clinical social worker Mrs. Collins came and partnered them for tutoring sessions.This book was full of emotions, but that wasn't the only thing that made me feel compelled to the book. It had a very entertaining start. There was humor and the characters instantly clicked the first time they collided. The chemistry was so good I can't help but sigh. I love Noahm he's a perfect book boyfriend. I love the way he's protective towards her brothers and towards Echo. Echo is also one adorable character. Although she's vulnerable at the start, I admired her character development-- how she became tough in dealing her dilemmas. The secondary characters are also adorable. Isaiah is so cute and although I don't kind of connect with Beth at the start, my feelings toward her changed at the last chapters of the book. And of course, I love Mrs. Collins. She's cool! Every guidance counselor should be like her!I just love this book! The only thing that kept me from rating it a perfect 5 was the \nromance\n . I love Noah and Echo's chemistry and their sizzling, make-out scenes but I was looking for more.

When her school counselor provides her with a tutoring job, Echo comes face-to-face with Noah...a fellow classmate who suffers torment of his own and sees Echo as some privileged, spoiled rich girl living the good life. However, these two lost souls slowly learn that they have more in common than they could ever imagine, and together, they face their demons in a fight for a chance at 'normalcy'.\u00a0\n\nThe worst type of crying wasn't the kind everyone could see--the wailing on the street corners, the tearing at clothes.

Echo was initially a pushover who easily conformed to what others expected of her--but I understood her need for love and acceptance as she falsely believed that allowing others to take the reins over her broken life would temporarily make things easier. \u00a0Her eventual 'I'm worthy' epiphany pretty much had me throwing fists in the air!This story was so wonderfully constructed and the author did an amazing job in bringing Echo's mental struggle to life.

If you haven\u2019t gotten this one on pre-order yet, go ye forth and do so. This is a 2012 must read. Since I write paranormal, I don\u2019t often get a chance to pick up YA contemporary. But obviously I\u2019m missing out. Especially if the other titles out there right now are half as engrossing as Katie McGarry\u2019s debut. After finishing this novel, I wanted to start it again. Because I missed the characters. They were THAT real to me. The relationships in this book are so tangible and heartrending and gut wrenchingly spot on.There are several threads running through this book at once, which is just one of the reasons that I loved this story so much. It\u2019s told from alternating points of view. So our two main characters, Echo and Noah, begin with their own agendas in mind, their own separate problems and struggles. Then, against their wills, they are brought together by their circumstances. As the story progresses, the lives of these two young people (and consequently their struggles) begin to intertwine. They become enmeshed with one another and I became enmeshed with them, snared by the aestheticism of their voices and their world and their all-too-real dilemmas. And I haven\u2019t even gotten to the romance in this novel, which is one of the major themes. Echo and Noah = HELLO CHEMISTRY.The sexual tension between the two is just about unbearable\u2014and that\u2019s delicious when that happens in a novel, isn\u2019t it? Sweet torture is what I\u2019ll call it. More than the tension, though, there is also a gradual build to the relationship between them. And I\u2019m a sucker for a romance that is layered by one moment or encounter at a time, and then another. I know I started this review by saying that this novel made me cry, but it also made me laugh. A lot. Ms. McGarry had a true gift for voice, and many of Echo\u2019s internal moments sent me over the edge with giggles. At one point, I had to put the book down because I was laughing so hard. And as for Noah, I can say that the male voice feels startlingly accurate--I think I gained many insights to the male brain! So I have a \u201cfavorites\u201d shelf in my house.

I have a weakness for big brothers caring for younger siblings after the death of a parent (see Storm). What can I say, I love a strong man who puts his siblings ahead of himself. Noah was a character I could get behind. And I liked the way his relationship progressed with Echo. It felt nicely paced to me and not insta-love-ish. I appreciated the talented writing and the restraint of Katie McGarry. I dug them together. I think that the story that captivated me the most was Noah's, actually. I enjoyed his voice the best. I felt like when the writer was talking as Echo, my feelings were being more manipulated, if that makes sense. However, I honestly loved reading each page of both Noah and Echo's journey. I have to say, though I really liked the main characters, the secondary characters were just loathsome. I wanted to bitch-slap Grace so hard!! She is a (insert nasty word HERE). I also didn't forgive Ashley (aka daddy-stealer... what? I would never get over that \"I just wanted to be your mom so badly\" BULL) and her emotion-void father. I think what pushed this to 5 stars for me was how well the author pulled me into the main character's lives. I was completely invested in their stories and I cared so freaking much about what happened to them. That is saying a lot.When I saw that there was a second book in the series, I was PISSED. I thought it would be a continuation of Echo and Noah's story (which, by the way, would have been totally unnecessary). I was so happy I could have done a little dance when I saw that it was Beth's story instead. Kate McGarry got the memo to leave well enough alone!!! (note: listen up Colleen Hoover!!!). I will most certainly be moving on with this series. **Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "NiCoLeTa E.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37314676-nicoleta-e", "userReview": "Wow!!! That was a GREAT book!!!!!I don't know how to expess to you how i felt reading that story, guys...It was riveting... It was redeptive... It was so... emotional....I really loved the two main characters.....They were fighters... and their lives was the fighting arena...Separated they were good, but when they were together was amazing....None of them was having an easy life, but together they overstepped every obstacle that get in their way and they earn a better life....Their past broke my heart.... but their future brought the smile in my lips...I admired their fighting spirits, even though sometimes they were cracked and gave up for a while.... They stood side by side and they did it!!!! Yeah!!!!\n\u201cI watched you battle against the worst memory of your life and I watched you win. Make no mistake, Echo. I battled right beside you. You need to find some trust in me \u2026 in us......If you\u2019re scared, tell me. If you need to cry and scream, then do it. And you sure as hell don\u2019t walk away from us because you think it would be better for me. Here\u2019s the reality, Echo: I want to be by your side. If you want to go to the mall stark naked so you can show the world your scars, then let me hold your hand. If you want to see your mom, then tell me that, too. I may not always understand, but damn, baby, I\u2019ll try.\u201d\nEcho's life had change the last three years.... The loss of her brother was unbareable and the ugly scars in her hands made her unsure of herself, so she stayed away from everyone and hiding... Her mind was having a black hole, she had lost her memories of her tragic accident.... She was forced to meet the school social worker for helping her out... Beyond that, her father was pressuring her too much... One day, she decided to rejoined the student body around her and the only thing that wanted was her life back to normal... But then, stepped in her life Noah and Noah was far from normal....Noah was having his own issues... His parents died in a fire accident 2,5 years before and he was forced to be separated from his little brothers... He was living in a foster home and it was forbidden to have contact with his brothers... All he ever wanted was to fight for reunited his little family, but they were many obstacles to overcome... He doesn't care for anything else than that... Until Echo makes an appearrance in his life...Noah and Echo shared a unique bond.... She feels safe with him... He never judge her, like all the others do, he never turned his eyes away when her scars are exposed and he is making a lot of efforts to help her to regain her memories.... From the other hand, Noah feels different with her and for the first time he feels love for other person than his brothers and his two closest friends... and that scares him... She want Echo, but how he can manage to be with her and to reunited his family????\nThe worst type of crying wasn\u2019t the kind everyone could see\u2014the wailing on street corners, the tearing at clothes. No, the worst kind happened when your soul wept and no matter what you did, there was no way to comfort it. A section withered and became a scar on the part of your soul that survived. For people like me and Echo, our souls contained more scar tissue than life.\nI won't say much more, i just wanna mention Mrs Collins... She was the one who brought Echo and Noah close to each other... And she was the one who with one or another way, tried to help them!!!! She was an amazing person...Well, i really liked that book... And i can't wait for Beth's story.... I'm on my way...."}, {"userName": "NMmomof4", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24665574-nmmomof4", "userReview": "[- Does Not have cheating- Does Not have a descriptive sex scene with OW/OM-  Does have both the h and H pushing away-  Does have a short separation between the h and H-  Does have abuse-  Does Not have OTT sad parts- Does Not have a HEA ending (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Annie Brewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5315988-annie-brewer", "userReview": "A MILLION STARS FOR THIS BOOK!!!!!! OMG, my emotions are all over the place!! I thought My Life Next Door was my favorite of this year, but HOLY HELL SHIT this book tops it....only by a little. But ummmmm, NOAH HUTCHINS IS MY NEW HOT SEXY BOOK BOYFRIEND. JESUS CHRIST I CAN EAT HIM UP!!!!!! I need a day to collect my thoughts before a proper review. So I am just going to say, well done Katie!!!! This was FANTASTIC!!!!Full review soon!Edited review:I have no idea where to begin with this review, my emotions are still very raw since I turned the last page of this book. But I will begin with the cover.....I LOVE THIS FREAKIN COVER. There are two different versions of this book. I got the hardback book the day it came out. OMG, as soon as it came out I was there. I called up my B&N and asked them to put this book on hold for me cause I was halling ass up there to get it! I feel like there was a wave of de ja vu. When I had this book in my hands, I clutched it to my chest and breathed in the book. Silly I know. But seriously, those two on the cover resemble very closely Noah and Echo. The other version is on ereader and I don't like that one as much. I am happy with the cover I've got. I mean look at them. First of all, the guy is smokin HOT and his position practically thrusting her up against the locker. Come on, that says enough right there. Oh yeah, I love it. And she's all leaning into him with her foot on the locker, supporting her. If I was her, I wouldn't be able to keep from collapsing with him that close. Damn! Anyway, you get the point, I love the book cover.When I first heard of this book, I was all over it. I looked up reviews and so many reviews raved about this book. I also noticed ALOT of comparison to Simone Elkles' Perfect Chemistry. And if you know me well enough, you know how much I devoured that book. SO it was a safe bet that I would love this book just as much. But guess what? I love this book even MORE!!! I'll always love my Alex Fuentes....but my heart has now found Noah Hutchins and I can't help but say, HOLY SHIT! He will rock your world, I promise!So now to get on with my review. Echo Emerson lost everything the night her brother died in Afghanistan and she woke up in the hospital with no recollection of what happened to her...except the scars on her arms now her mom has a restraining order against her. She walks the halls like a zombie and is scared to be hersef around her friends that were there for her before the incident. Now they turn their back on her because she is different. They treat her like an outsider. She was dating popular boy Luke and when it got to be too much for her, she broke it off and quit going to school.Her dad wanted her to get help. So she starts seeing social worker Mrs. Collins who tries everything she can to help Echo remember what happened that night that tore her family apart. Once she remembers, she might feel better and can finally sleep in peace for the first time in 2 years. In the mean time, she tutors a boy for chemistry, who is not much different than her....Noah lost everything the night of the house fire 2 years earlier, which claimed his parents. His brothers were taken away and he was bouncing from foster family to foster family. Until Mrs. Collins became his social worker, claiming she could help him get his life back on track. Getting tutored by Echo was the last thing he expected...but maybe it was the best thing that ever happened to him. Together they worked to get answers about their past, that might help them both heal and face a future that is unknown. But can they do it together or will it shatter their world even more?WOW, when I finished this book last night, I felt numb. I'm not saying there wasn't an HEA and I'm not saying there is. I'm saying from the moment I opened the book and started the first page, I felt every emotion from giddy, happy, funny, angry, sad, confused, back to angry, sad and everything inbetween. There were so many emotions going through me at once that it became hard to distinguish which emotion I was actually going through. The fact that both characters were facing such tough choices in their lives, it made my heart ache for them so badly. They started off kind of hostile toward each other. Noah felt that Echo was just this selfish, princess bitch that always got her way. And Echo assumed that Noah was this pot smoking, drinker asshole bad boy that everyone made him out to be. Their relationship grew slowly and intense once they realized that they were so much alike. They were both struggling with demons of their own, but trying to be themselves in the process. Noah was the sweetest, most wonderful guy Echo could have ever met. He supported her and even when he saw her ugly scars that covered her arms, he never turned away. Not once. And he even told her she was still beautiful. No one ever treated her the way Noah did. It was so beaituful to see their relationship blossom and intensify as time went on. I cried, laughed,smiled, cursed, pulled my hair, yelled at Noah, told some of them off throughout the book. There were some unexpected twists and dammit if I wasn't already distraught. Katie threw in some really crazy and sad shit in there. For giggles? I don't know, but I wasn't laughing. I cried so hard, I had to stop a few times to collect myself cause I couldn't see the pages. I understood their pain, losing a parent is never easy. My heart ached the whole way through with Noah. I wanted to hug him. Then at one point he tries getting custody of his 2 younger brothers once he graduates high school. OMG, that whole situation with that was hard to deal with. I had a hard time breathing, seeing the pain Noah went through. All he wanted was his brothers together again, their family minus their parents. And when you learn the truth about what happened that night, you're just even more broken up about it! It is truly sad!I loved all of the secondary characters. Noah's best friends Beth and Isaiah were amazing! They were such good friends and support for Noah. They really looked after him and stuck by him, even when they were unsure about Echo. Beth kinda ticked me off at times. But I realized it was only to protect Noah's heart. I grew to love her.I only liked Lila, Echo's best friend. Even though at first she pissed me off, she turned her shit around and showed her better side.I hate Grace and Luke and all the rest that were so judgmental and hateful. Little bastards! I punch their faces in! I loved when Noah and Luke fought at the dance. OMG, I was rooting for him to beat the shit out of Luke. Yeah, I'm volitile. Oh well.I liked Echo's dad and her step mom, eventhough there was alot of drama with that. But OMG I wanted to kill her fucking mom!!!! I felt bad for her. I really did. But when I found out the truth, HOLY FUCKING SHIT, I wanted to slap myself for feeling sorry for that horrible bitch! I loved Noah's little brothers. OMG, my heart hurt for them. Their foster parents really warmed my heart but I still felt a stab of sadness for Noah because he wanted to adopt them so badly. But in the end, things worked out for the best. And my favorite character in this, Mrs. Collins...she was the glue to the whole thing. She was amazing! She never gave up on either of them. She showed them that to trust and put faith first, things will aways work out. I loved her so much for everything she did for them! Ugh, its bringing on the waterworks again! Just thinking about this book, makes me want to sob all over again. It was a beautiful story about love, friendship, trust, starting over, healing, and moving on. The end. Oh my the ending was AMAZING! I loved it so much! Seriously, this book brought out so many raw emotions from me. I highly recommend this book to all romance lovers. Trust me, this book will consume you. And you'll be left thinking about it long after you turn the last page!! So all you PC fans, prepare for a story that will rock you, sock you, knock you on your ass! It's truly SPECTACULAR!!!! I am definitely reading more from this author!! Fantastic debut Mrs. McGarry!!!!"}, {"userName": "Taryn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2724584-taryn", "userReview": "This review is posted at My Secret RomanceWhat a bittersweet emotional story. A favorite by far this year.\nThe worst type of crying wasn't the kind everyone else could see- the wailing on street corners, the tearing at clothes. No, the worst kind happened when your soul wept and no matter what you did, there was no way to comfort it. A section withered and became a scar on the part of your soul that survived. For people like me and Echo, our souls contained more scar tissue than life.\nThis book tugged on so many of my emotions from heartfelt love to disdain. Pushing the Limits did just that to me- pushed me as far as I could go. I had to step back and reel in my emotions quite a few times since it was hitting so close to home, again. I've been so blessed to read so many wonderful authors lately who have left such imprints on me, and Katie McGarry is another one who has. This is a book that I could never, ever, forget.Echo...poor Echo. What this girl had to endure at such a young age is not something most could handle. Hell, it was hard reading at times for me. An extremely traumatic event caused such repercussions on Echo mental state that she blacked it out. Now with the help of a clinical social worker, she is working on recovering her memory and the reason behind the scars on her arms. It's a slow process, as it should be, since she went too fast the last time and her brain couldn't handle it all landing her in the hospital for a few days. Not only is Echo trying to remember her past and the scars, she's dealing with the death of the one person who made such a massive influence on her life, her brother Aries.Aside from working to uncover such disturbing moments in her life that she can't bring herself to believe, Echo returns to high school her senior year to find everyone staring and whispering about her. It's not easy for the once popular girl who had it all. Her friends are doing everything possible to put her back up on the social latter, even begging her to go back to dating Luke, which is the last thing Echo seems to want. What she does want is normal. She wants to be normal again and she finds it in the person she least expected to- the bad boy in school, dealing with issues as heavy as hers and also in foster care, Noah.Add in the cattiness of the students in high school, a pushy father who wants his daughter to excel, and a pregnancy by someone who Echo feels tore her family apart. Echo's emotions are all over the place and she's hurt the most by the ones she loves. Yet in this addicting story of survival and quest to find truth, Echo finds solace in the one person she never thought she would. The first 25% didn't do much to me. I didn't care for some of Echo's friends and how they treated her. At one point I felt like there were too many characters thrown in and I was having a hard time following. There was no connection, no emotion, nothing...and then BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks and I was glued to this book right after! Good heavens what this book did to me! I am in awe over this story. I'm just..bewildered at how realistic and how moving Pushing the Limits is. It's brilliant! I am at a loss of words. All I know is that everyone should read this book. There is a beautiful story to be told and lessons to learn.It's funny how Echo was dealing with repressed events in her life. I hadn't realized I blocked out some events in my life until I read some scenes and they came roaring back to me. I hated reliving them, but it just made the book that much more for me because the author really nailed each one. No sugar coating and no fluff- it's all described exactly how it happens. As much as it hurt to remember, I felt like I was Echo and even Noah at times and dealing with the same struggles. You don't have to deal with any painful experiences for you to connect with the characters or story. The author does a superb job with their backgrounds and story development to lure you in when you least expect it. Well done Katie McGarry! I'm very much looking forward to the next book in this series.Favorites lines:Nothing increased your confidence level like being insulted by a stoner.\"Echo, I can't tell you what's going to happen because I don't know. I don't hold hands in the hallway or sit at anyone's table. But I swear...on my brothers that you'll never be a joke to me and you'll be much more than a girl in the backseat of my car.\" -Noah to EchoHe killed my soul and and I wanted his in return.\"Come here, baby.\" And with my words, Echo leaned into me: soft, pliant, broken. \"You're not alone,\" I whispered into her hair as I cradled her in my arms. \"You're not alone because you have me.\"And I love you, more than you could ever know.This book was provided by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Zain Otoom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45136398-zain-otoom", "userReview": "\"Because growing up means making tough choices, and doing the right thing doesn't necessarily mean doing the thing that feels good.\"*****You know it's a good book when you'll never look at certain things the same way. This book was such an unexpectedly good read. I picked it up thinking it was like any cheesy romance book out there. Boy, I was wrong. Now, I never had to deal with any of the problems that the main characters had to, nor do I know people in real life who had. But I do know that the author dealt with these problems quite realistically. It was really hard sometimes to read because of all the mess going on. My heart would be teared into pieces just reading certain chapters. I teared up a couple of times, but I also smiled widely many times; especially at the end. I love it when characters grow.Not to mention, this book does send out some really great messages, but I like feel mentioning them would be a spoiler. Besides, not everyone get the same experience reading the same book. You'll probably latch on specific things that will stand out to you. Why one star off? Well, I wanted a different kind of romance in this book, one that suited the tone of it. It felt off sometimes. But don't take that as a con. Honestly, just ignore the romance and focus on the other things that this book gives you."}, {"userName": "Natalia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52662522-natalia", "userReview": "That was great. When I started this book I thought it would be some kind of clich\u00e9 story about a good girl and a bad boy. But surprisingly it turned out to be way more. So much more. The thing that impressed me the most were the character. As I said I was expecting clich\u00e9 and one dimensional characters, but they weren\u2019t. They were complex and they had their own stories and problems to overcome. I love how they helped each other and how deeply they cared for each other. They had a great relationship. I absolutely loved them together. Also their family stories were very well developed. The messed up story with her mother, her relationship with her father, her stepmother, her brother, her friends and that\u2019s only Echo\u2019s. Noah has lots of family problems as well.
