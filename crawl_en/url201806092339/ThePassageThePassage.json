It comes in like a vampire thriller and goes out like a batty soap opera. And it's big! Spreading its bat wings, it measures in at 766 pages (or at least the ARC version does). TWILIGHT this ain\u2019t, and regular vampire fare it isn\u2019t either. It\u2019s a hodgepodge of Bram Stoker, Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and John Steinbeck: one if by vampires, two if by military games, three if by bloodbath, and four if by brotherly melodrama.Overall I liked it. Honest. I don\u2019t read 766 pages during the school year easily. \u201cBig Mo\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cMomentum\u201d to you young folk) carried me through as the Laws of Physics applied. Meaning? Cronin got this off to such a sick start that the action carried me. I couldn\u2019t put it down.The opening plot line was simple: Dr. Strangelove goes to South America to find the cure for death and instead turns it loose. You can always count on your military brass for that sort of screw up, no? You see, they wanted a serum from these batty vampires living deep in the jungles (only why didn\u2019t they migrate and take in... er, over... the world, like they did later in the book?) so they could extract the GOOD part of vampirism (you know, extended life, superhuman strength, and damn near indestructibility) without the bad part (bad skin, bad breath, restricted diet, No Exit signs in the Mortality Room, etc.). The idea was to give the serum to U.S. soldiers and then look out world! That's right, the USA would be able to kick some North Korean slash Al Qaedan slash Taliban butt!You know the drill, though: the best laid plans of bats and uniformed men.... At their underground Telluride, CO, fortress, the Army injects 12 death row inmates and one special little 6-year-old girl (hint: key to the book) and keeps them under lock and key (and 12-foot steel walls and multiple doors and so on) for observation. Only the hanging upside down former prisoners, now \u201cvirals\u201d (that\u2019s the word for them in this tome), are playing with their guards\u2019 minds because they want to come out and play. Can you say \u201ctelepathic disaster\u201d? Uh-huh. All hell breaks loose and the score winds up being Hell 1 and U.S. Army 0.Here\u2019s where the book takes wing. These nasty hobbits come out of nowhere and rip you open like a can of beets. Every couple of dozen victims are just \u201cscratched\u201d on the throat so they can become part of the Viral Army. And soon America as we know it and love it turns into Cormac McCarthy PlayLand. Yep. It\u2019s THE ROAD all over again. Dystopia with teeth. And compelling stuff, too. We go to various outposts where certain humans have figured out certain ways to survive. Lights, chiefly. Because the virals are creatures of the night and don\u2019t like the spotlight. Where the wheels start to wobble is halfway through. Suddenly Cronin plays fast and loose with his own rules. Suddenly a viral attack develops more than two possible results (death and the equivalent of taxes \u2013 being a vampire for life). Suddenly \u201cthe good guys\u201d (i.e. major characters) are given preferential treatment. And he delves more deeply into the social life of our hearty crew of humans, too, including a fraternal rivalry between bros named Theo and Peter. This is the Steinbeck part -- East of Eden, West of Transylvania. Here Cronin gets a little too sentimental for my tastes, too, especially with the single \u201cgood vampire\u201d Amy, who has none of the bad attributes (elongated bicuspids, penchant for Bloody Marys) but all the good ones (extended life, telepathic abilities, the keys to the city and the book, etc.).In the end, the virals become less scary, the bag loses some of its punch, and you're flipping pages just to find out how Cronin ties this mess together. Then, when you get to the promised land, you see that he doesn\u2019t. Then you see on the Internet that this is the just the first of three books. Then you say, \"Oh, no!\" and ask yourself how in hell a book just south of 800 pp. would ever need a sequel when it's too long by far already. Finally, you collect yourself and recall where you are \u2013 the United States of A-Royalties. This, after all, is supposed to be the Summer Blockbuster of 2010! This, after all, is supposed to be money in Cronin's (and Random House's) bank! This is a book already in the cinematic pipelines with Ridley Scott as director. Fasten your seat belts, then. Get home before dark and pay your electric bill, too. This won't be the last you hear of THE PASSAGE.Five stars for the first half, three for the second. I'll rate it down the middle and let you judge this glorious, bloody mess for yourself.

You promised me such wonderful things with your sparkly cover, your titillating title (a passage to WHERE??), and your massive hype. Also your sizable heft, as you are a large, obese book, full of words and things. I figured if I didn't like you, I could use you to stone evil-doers in some town square somewhere. How could I turn you down?Your promises, though, were only partially fulfilled. While I enjoyed stoning people in the village square with you, your cover was simply too pretty to be true, and your title too vague to really *mean* anything. I still don't know what the passage was, but it was full of vampire-things and massive doses of character backstory that also didn't really *mean* anything... except make you a very, very heavy book. Brick-like, really. I believe next I'll tie a ransom note to you and throw you through a window, just for the giggles.You had such lovely backstory, such vivid characters in your opening quarter, I couldn't put you down. Well, I could, because you are a fatass and my arms grew lethargic and weak after about an hour, but figuratively speaking. I was hooked, and I loved you for it. Vivid characters, shocking scenery, emotion. You had it all, baby.But then things changed. Oh, did they change. You forgot your old ways and introduced me to a whole slew of new characters. Characters that I didn't care about, in a situation that seemed so distant and unreal compared to your sharply defined predecessors that I thought perhaps I was reading a different book. Gone were the late nights of voracious reading. Gone were my massive biceps developed from holding you at a readable height. I slogged through you, sometimes telling friends that you were \"getting better,\" even daring to say \"really good again\" in whispered tones... but you would then disappoint, like a dog who is allergic to grass, and I would yell angrily at perfect strangers that you were a meandering, lame book with stupid characters and unbelievable situations. I finished you, though, because I had devoted a better part of the year reading you, and I had to see it through. Like climbing Everest, I just wanted to *breath* again, but I knew I had to finish you anyway.And see you through I did, to an ending that only set you up for a sequel, likely full of more meaningless backstory and characters painstakingly developed over 100's of pages only to be forgotten or rendered unimportant. I did not spend 3 weeks reading you to get a cliffhanger, damnit. !@#$ you, The Passage. !@#$ you.Goodbye, The Passage. You were a good workout, and my man-arms thank you. But you were bit of a slog and kind of boring.

With some terrific reviews, this was immediately one of THE BOOKS TO READ for summer 2010, a vampire tale not written by Stephanie Meyer, and not even promoted very much as vampiric. Maybe our capacity for reading vampire novels has clotted somewhat?The world in question begins in 2022. Gas is $13 a gallon. Iranian jihadists have killed hundreds at the Mall of America. Jenna Bush is Texas guv (this is a horror story, after all). New Orleans, battered by another monster storm, is now an uninhabitable industrial park. An expedition to a remote corner of South America, sponsored by the US Army, is searching for a promising and dangerous virus. What could possibly go wrong? The Passage is nothing if not very, very derivative. Although there are a few nifty new notions within its 766 pages, (I will not spoil them by telling) there will be little here that is not almost immediately familiar. Government projects gone wrong, post-apocalyptic struggles for survival, battles between good and evil, strong people, weak people, and lots and lots of vampires.That said, I felt that there were almost two complete, independent books within the whole. The first tells of the beginning of the unpleasantness, lasts for 246 pages and is gripping. I hated to put the book down. Even with the been-there-read-that aspect of the book, there was something about the writing of that 246 pages that kept me turning the pages, thirsty for more. As for the remaining 520, not so much. We move forward almost a century and enter the too-familiar landscape of post-apocalyptic survival. Although there were elements here that were interesting, some characters that held promise, I found it a very, very long yawn. I also felt that the author cheated a few times too many in leading us to believe that certain events had taken place when they had not. He even jokes about it in the writing, having one character say out loud what any reader might wonder about how a particular event transpired. If The Passage had kept up the frantic and so-engaging pace of its long opening, it would indeed have been one of THE BOOKS TO READ this summer. Instead of reading The Passage, though, I would look for an alternate route.I gave it two stars instead of one because the beginning was so good. Otherwise, I resented the time it took to read this waaaaaay too long book."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "when i read horror, i'm usually looking for: (1) cheap thrills or (2) surreal and metaphysical weirdness or, best of all, (3) \nan epic full of dread and melancholy\n. there is plenty of the first sort and so much of it is trash. but fun can be had with trashy things and i'm no snob. the second type can be a little more hard to find, but there's a lot to be had as well, if you look in the right places, especially the past. but the third kind, that's the hardest, i've only found a few. Declare, It, The Terror. and The Passage. in a lot of horror, i'm not exactly eager to slowly lose myself in the world depicted - the experience is often more like a rollercoaster or a fun nightmare. but that last category, those mournful sagas - they are my special favorites. i may not want to live in a novel's world, but if it is a world that is so carefully crafted and then grown, one filled with tragedy and sadness and coming together and coming undone... i find it very easy to get lost in those worlds. it is a great feeling.so on to The Passage. it is an excellent novel, complete with multi-leveled characters, spiritual mysteries, exciting action set pieces, and the trappings of several genres (vampire, post-apocalypse, and in the first third, an on-the-run-from-the-government-style thriller). the writing is solid, well-crafted, and certainly in no rush. particularly outstanding is the depth of characterization present in even minor or elusive characters such as the scientist Lear or the child molestor Grey. the first third of the novel is pretty much perfect, tightly-paced yet generous with motivation and context, and featuring three of the most warmly written and sympathetic characters i've come across in a while: Agent Wolgast & Sister Lacey & Anthony Carter: fallen agent, unearthly nun, misunderstood criminal. the empathy created by the author for these three and the depth of their background stories... i just really was not expecting that and it was wonderful to experience.unlike many other readers, i felt the remaining two-thirds were very strong, moving easily between a wide range of physical and emotional landscapes, from complex world-building to pointed irony to moments of eerie beauty to straight-up horror (particularly in the Haven sequence). although it could be said that characterization was a bit less rich in the last two-thirds, the range of emotions depicted was often on a wider and more dynamic scale - the reader is able to watch characters actually grow and change. i appreciated Cronin's vampires. they certainly run against the current grain! although the threat of their bizarre, bestial presence looms over the entire novel, they remain enjoyably enigmatic and largely in the background. i assume the amount of attention paid to the vampire Babcock and his traumatic past (also very well done) will be paralleled in the sequels by depictions of the remaining vampires. The Passage has been compared to The Stand; personally i think The Passage is superior. my only real issue is the very ending, which could come across as cheaply ironic and unnecessarily brutal if it wasn't clear that this is only book 1 of 3. i assume that this disturbing cliffhanger of an ending will eventually be resolved with the same sensitivity and grace brought to the rest of the novel's various episodic sequences."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "Epic . . . very, very Epic!I feel like I just read about 5 books. Not because it was long, but just because there is so much story here that changes direction so many times. I cannot believe there are still two books to go . . . I mean, I can believe it because there is more story to tell, but how much more epic can this get!?4.5 out of 5 starsThis one lost a little for me in the middle due to a blah transition that caused me to lose interest for a period of time. Looking back after knowing what happened, it makes sense, but it was slow for a bit. So, if you are reading this review before you read the book, know that you should not give up if you get bored in the middle . . . this too shall pass!In addition to being epic, this was great story telling. And, despite the size, there really wasn\u2019t filler. Each page, each paragraph, each sentence had its place and kept the story moving (even during the blah part!). From deep, meaningful conversations to gore-filled action sequences, the story was always moving on to the next place and had me hungry to find out what was next.If you like post-apocalyptic and monster stories, but need a new twist and are not afraid to invest a lot of time, you should read this.

This is Wolf Blitzer from CNN\u2019s The Situation Room, the program that tries to make viewers think that you\u2019re seeing the busy hub of television journalism instead of admitting that despite our high-tech looking set and satellite feeds, you\u2019d probably learn more about what\u2019s actually going on in the world by looking out your window.We turn our focus now to growing rumors that the U.S. Army is conducting secret medical experiments on American soil. The bizarre claims seem like something out of a Stephen King novel yet despite repeated denials by the Defense Department the stories continue to grow, and documents posted on WikiLeaks seem to support some of this.Is this just an urban myth gaining popularity thanks to the internet, or is there something to these rumors? Joining me now via satellite from his office is Major John Smith, a spokesman from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Major, thanks for joining us.Major John Smith: Thanks for having me.Wolf Blitzer: So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of these persistent stories circulating, Major.MJS: *laughs* Yes, they\u2019re keeping my office quite busy.WB: And the Army\u2019s position is that they\u2019re absolutely unfounded?MJS: Of course. Frankly, Wolf, I\u2019m surprised we even have to bother discussing this. It\u2019s obviously the work of internet hoaxsters.WB: But what about the documentation that\u2019s leaked out?MJS: They are clearly forgeries. Have you read this stuff? Secret bases on U.S. soil? Convicted felons recruited and used for guinea pigs for drug trials to extend human life? Vampire-like creatures that have some kind of telepathic connection and cause bad dreams? I think someone just posted an old X-Files script. I find it sad that Americans are wasting time on this nonsense.WB: It does seem outlandish, but let\u2019s talk a few specifics. The documents mention a Project Noah that the USAMRIID is running. And there are line items in the USAMRIID budget for a Project Noah for a significant amount of money.MJS: I can confirm that there is a Project Noah, and while it\u2019s top-secret, I have been authorized to disclose that it involves research into cutting edge medical technologies that could be used to save more lives on the battlefield. That\u2019s all I can say about it. But it\u2019s obvious that these conspiracy theorists just took a real project name and used it for their own purposes.WB: So there never was a research team funded by USAMRIID that was slaughtered in the jungles of Central America while seeking a virus sample that could greatly boost human healing abilities?MJS: Of course not. Unfortunately, we did have a team in that area that was researching a botany project, and they did sustain casualties after accidentally coming across some local drug runners, but that\u2019s all it was.WB: And the USAMRID does not have government agents recruiting death row prisoners to be the subjects of experimental drug trials?MJS: Again, that\u2019s ridiculous.WB: So where have these prisoners gone, Major?MJS: Considering they were death row inmates, I think it\u2019s safe to say they got executed.WB: I assume you\u2019ll also deny the existence of this secret lab, hidden somewhere underground in the Rocky Mountains?MJS: Absolutely. WB: What about reports from Telluride, Colorado, of citizens having the same nightmares and behaving strangely?MJS: Complete nonsense. I\u2019m based in Telluride myself, and I sleep just fine.WB: One last question, Major. A new wave of rumors regarding a small girl in Memphis being abducted by government agents have begun circulating today. Any comment?MJS: The idea that the US Army had anything to do with abducting children is absurd, Wolf. Think about these stories. Does it really seem possible that the U.S. government has a secret base in Colorado where we\u2019re experimenting with a virus on convicts and small children that turns them into some kind of Dracula-type creature with the ability to invade dreams and brainwash people. Seriously, what\u2019s next? I\u2019m sure the people who believe that will tell you that it\u2019s inevitable that some kind of accident will unleash the virus on an unsuspecting public, and that the country will be consumed by a plague of these creatures until civilization is completely destroyed. And then what? Maybe a small handful of survivors will manage to establish a safe zone and a new type of society? Oh, and a couple of generations down the line, like a hundred years from now, a few of these survivors will embark on an odyssey to find the truth in a post-apocalyptic landscape? Does that really seem likely, Wolf?WB: *chuckles* When you put it that way, Major, it does seem pretty far fetched\u2026. (Crashing noises and screams are heard.)WB: Major, what\u2019s happened? Are you alright?MJS: Ugh.. I\u2019m perfectly\u2026Arr\u2026 fine, Wolf. Ow! Just..uh\u2026 just dropped a glass. Arrgh..WM: Major, I don\u2019t mean to argue with you, but it seems like some kind of horrible vampire-like creature has just burst into your office and is biting you.MJS: That\u2019s\u2026UHH\u2026totally ridiculous\u2026. Oh, shit!\u2026. Ow\u2026 This is \u2026 arrr\u2026 my assistant\u2026. EH!.. He just has\u2026.owwww.. low blood sugar. Arrrghh\u2026 WB: Well, you\u2019re obviously busy, Major. We\u2019ll let you go now. Thanks for your time.MJS: My plesur\u2026 OWWWW!\u2026 HOLY JESUS SOMEBODY SHOOT THIS GODDAMN\u2026..WB: It appears we lost the link. So did we just see a US Army officer get his face gnawed off by a vampire-like creature that he had just finished denying the existence of? Or is this just another internet hoax? We may never know.

With a delay. The Passage was a publishing sensation of 2010 - cleverly marketed as The Stand meeting The Road, its gorgeous cover (will you just look at these trees!) immediately caught attention of readers, and even its bulk was not discouraging - after all, who does not enjoy getting caught up in a good novel? Publishing details topped the cake: Cronin received a $5 million advance payment: $3.5 for the publishing rights to The Passage and two planned sequel (in North America alone), and Riddley Scott bought the rights to film the novel for $1,5 million. A relatively unknown novelists whose previous output consists of just two slim novels - Mary and O'Neil: A Novel in Stories and The Summer Guest - both of which having nothing to do with end of the world, vampires, infections, and an epic on a grand scale. Where did this surprising development came from? I have no idea, but apparently this goose lays eggs of gold. Stephen King sealed the deal, giving the novel a glowing recommendation: \"It has the vividness that only epic works of fantasy and imagination can achieve...read this book and the ordinary world disappears\" (King also blurbed Hannibal as being better than both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs - I can understand much but I genuinely have no idea where he got that idea from). And did you know that the author of this huuuge novel with vampires is a professor of English at Rice Univeristy in Texas? Get it? Rice? LOL!Although the novel has been compared to The Stand, I see another comparison which would be way more apt; Robert McCammon's Swan Song, another gargantuan post-apocalyptic epic. Unlike The Stand, McCammon's novel has largely failed the test of time. Although one cannot deny the author his efforts and ambition, it remains deeply rooted in the 80's fear of a nuclear war - which is not essentially a bad thing. What is bad is that it's populated by cartoony characters and sugary sentimentality, with little or no ambiguity. Still, there is a certain merit to Swan Song resulting from nostalgia - it's the epitome of the bulky paperback novel which once was what captured our attention and kept us reading late into the night when we were younger and did not mind its flaws, captivated instead by the story which still had time to get old and cliched. Now, the Huge Post-Apocalyptic Epics are a thing of the past - most novels concerned with life after the Big Bad are much slimmer, and adressed to young adults. And here, in 2010, Justin Cronin brought it back to life! How could we not get excited? We still remember reading The Stand years ago and hoped for at least a glimpse of that feeling.The trouble is that this is the 21st century - the author would be hard pressed to come up with new ideas instead of relying on all familiar plot devices and developments...and well, he doesn't. The novel opens with a weak first act, consisting mainly of a stereotypical story of a young mother and her troubles; eventually it gets so bad that she has to sell her body, and then she leaves her daughter at a convent. There is also a B-movie like episode of scientists investigating some wild occurences in South America. Then two cops show up on the stage and have to take the girl who was left at the convent and deliver her to the feds - for some unknown reason (probably because she's a messiah character). The author likes backstories - instead of letting these characters act and come to life, he dumps pages after pages of their past on the poor reader's conscience - care damnit! It does not help that all the characters are bland as hell - the child with hidden powers, the good cop/bad cop routine, an innocent prisoner and I swear that there's even a Magical Negro in there and this hasn't been cool since John Coffey. But something finally starts to happen - the promised apocalypse is sloowly starting to boil!Aaaaaaaand that is the moment the novel takes a surprising leap! Around quarter through it the reader is suddenly and unexpectedly catapulted into the future, and introduced to a completely new set of characters who are left in the world AFTER the apocalypse happened. The fireworks went off, and we weren't even there! The post-apocalypic world itself I did not find to be very interesting - anyone even vaguely familiar with the themes the author approaches will find little, if any, surprises in this part of the text. While the first part of the book manages to maintain at least a mild sort of interest in the reader, the rest of the book is meandering and unfocused, never gaining any real momentum. In over a thousand pages periliously little happens, and the narrative feels stretched to the maximum - and to top that any possible violent or sexual content The Passage is consciously toned down by the author, probably to met the PG13 and reach the younger audience. This is reflected in the relative simplicity of the storyline, complete with melodramatic expressions in all the right places (\"Oh, How he loved her\").And at the end of the novel there's a giant cliffganger, meaning that the whole thing was just a set up for the other two novels - the sequel has just been published. Loose ends will probably be tied in the subsequent installments - but to take a hardly original idea and stretch into a sprawling and overlong novel which barely accomplishes anything on its own makes me not be at all excited about reading them."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "This book got me to the important realization that zombies are just vampires gone retarded."}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "When it comes to Science Fiction or Fantasy that has a literary aspect to it, I usually have to step back & ask myself:\"Mary, did you enjoy this because it was good? Or did you enjoy it because it was written well?\" Such was the case with Justin Cronin's The Passage. Did I like this book? Well. Yes and no. At times. Sort of. I guess. This book has its really excellent moments, but it has some not so excellent moments too & that makes assessing the work as a whole difficult to say the least. It's honestly hard to even summarize neatly what you will find if you choose to pick up this title. There are many things happening all at once; constant switches in points of view, character histories, and the current plot line all jockeying for your attention. The best way to describe it is a story about a web of interconnected people and how they all interact with each other while they deal with the end of the world. Another important thing to note is that this book could easily have been split into two books. In fact, if you read the blurb it does an excellent job of encompassing the first half of this book, which in my opinion is spectacular.Cronin begins on an incredibly strong note with a character that immediately grabbed my attention & kept me engaged on an emotional & intellectual level. I remained fully locked into the story for almost all of the first half, and had it been a separate book on its own I probably would have rated it a 4-4.5 stars at the very least. But then...There is massive jump in the timeline right smack dab in the middle of this 766 page (or 37.5 hours on audio) book & while sometimes that technique works, in this case I consider it a negative.The story fast forwards a hundred years into the future & that my friends is where I lost my groove almost completely. Once I reached this leap, I set the book down for what? Maybe 2 weeks? Which is quite a long time for me & my normal reading speed. The characters I cared about were no longer at the forefront of the story, the aspects that kept my attention were replaced with a much less intriguing set of circumstances, and I had to seriously consider whether or not I wanted to continue.That's not to say that the last half of this book turned out to be dreadful. It definitely is not. But the abrupt gear change & the feeling that I was tricked into reading the first two books in this series instead of just the first was something I couldn't shake. Where the first part of the book felt very careful & intentional with how it introduced each character to the situation, the second part haphazardly tossed a new cast of characters at me whose faces were hardly developed in my mind before we were off on the next adventure. I never formed any sort of bond with anyone from the second half of the story & while certain parts of the narrative held my attention more than others, this lack of connection absolutely affected my ability to care about what was going on. The switching perspectives in the first half were brilliantly timed & once the threads were woven together I could see a beautiful & terrible picture. This technique applied to the second half felt careless & without the precision I had come to expect from the previous chapters. Even the writing style, which was pleasingly descriptive & tonally appropriate suffered from the lack of adequate characterization. Where before I had been actively focused in on the details, I came to find them tedious & exhausting by the end of the story. At this point, I'm not sure that I want to continue with The Passage series. While there's no denying Cronin has the ability to write deeply engaging characters & spin a distinctive tale out of a trope we've seen many times before, I'm not sure I can fully trust him to keep the focus of the story relevant across two more books equally as massive as this one is.

I picked this one up solely based on an interview the  New York Times  did with the author. Of course, the interviewer was asking Cronin if he read Twilight (he hadn\u2019t.) Is Twilight REALLY the be-all, end-all of vampire books? This book runs circles around that teenage sop-fest. A better comparison would be Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. Actually, an even better comparison would be to the movie The Village (without the awkward twist) or George Stewart\u2019s Earth Abides. When I first picked up this book, I considered not reading it because it was 766 pages and that seemed way too long. However, I read the first sentence and got sucked in: Before she became the Girl from Nowhere -- the One Who Walked In, the First and Last and Only, who lived a thousand years, she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy. Amy Harper Bellafonte. It took me about a week to get through this book -- I couldn't put it down (except to sleep and work.)Cronin\u2019s writing is exquisite. I felt like I truly knew (and cared about) the characters. I was even sympathetic to the vamps (or virals as they\u2019re called in this book). Let\u2019s face it, his vampires are the creatures in the night you warn your children about, not the ones you want to make out with. I couldn\u2019t get a good sense of what they looked like, but I visualized something that was a little human, a little praying mantis and a little bat. And let me tell you, the thought scared the bejeezus out of me. It was a fascinating read. I love reading these post-apocalyptic books because there\u2019s such a sense of hope. Even when the world is overrun by scary bloodsucking bat-things, pockets of humanity somehow find a way to survive. I need to start stockpiling batteries and canned food!The ending is a little abrupt \u2013 and hopefully what appears to happen doesn\u2019t actually happen.

Secondly, most of the first half is very good but then it descended into the realms of dull, futuristic nonsense of the type that completely switches me off.Let me clarify. I like apocalyptic tales of the end of the world as we know it. I'm interested in the different ways it could come about and how people react when the reality of their situation dawns. I also like the stories that develop from the immediate effects of the bomb or the virus or the collision with another planet that bring current events to an unseemly end. Books such as  The Stand and  Seveneves cover the initial catastrophe and its immediate aftermath really well, but then they descend in to fantasy and far future science fiction, respectively. This book drops in the same trick as Seveneves in that having engaged your interest in a group of characters and their fates it suddenly abandons them and leaps forward about a hundred years to an imaginary world I found totally unengaging. Moreover, the characters I\u2019d invested so much time and emotion in are, of course, now nowhere to be seen. I know many will disagree with this view, and that's fine with me. I know my limitations. I've never been able to deal with supernatural figures, ghosts, demons or worlds where the science or social rules are far removed from what l\u2019m familiar with. Call it a lack of imagination if you like. My favourite science fiction novel is probably  The Road and I think that's because although the events that caused 'the end\u2019 are only referenced briefly and obliquely, the world it leaves behind feels believable. I could relate to it.For all that, I\u2019ll continue to seek out books that deal with this scenario because it\u2019s something that has a huge draw for me.

I found the society and government established to precariously survive this new and dangerous world was very well constructed, and grew to care about all of these characters. Knowing now that the book is the first in a trilogy, I think Cronin would have been better served ending the first here, with central characters departing on their heroes' journey. The last third just seemed rushed to me. Too many characters resolving too neatly; too many details about the viral plague explained mystically, rather than scientifically. Above all, I found myself very frustrated by the end.

I need to mention I won this book in GoodReads Giveaways.A high-secret military experiment (some scientists decided to play God) went Terribly Wrong and as a result a terrible virus is unleashed in the wild. I had trouble suspending my disbelief when I realized the virus already existed in a remote place; it would be more believable if it was artificially created. It kills the lucky majority of infected people; unlucky few who do not die become - for all practical purposes - vampires. They love garlic and do not care much about holy water and crucifixes, but otherwise they behave exactly like their famous great-great-great-grandfather Count Dracula. The humanity is practically wiped out on North American continent; the scattered groups of survivors have no idea what is going on in other places on Earth and some of them are not even aware other such groups exist. One seemingly ordinary day several people in one completely isolated group found what they think a mere glimmer of hope for all survivors. Other circumstances force them to act upon the information they have. Good old-fashion carnage ensures. This part of the book does have a strong Max Max (the original) Vibe. I would like to discuss the book weaknesses first. Once upon a time there lived a German philosopher Immanuel Kant who according to Wikipedia is now considered to be the central figure of the modern philosophy. The first logical question a this point would be, \" What the heck does Kant who lived in eighteenth century have anything to do with the book I am trying to review here?\" With all of his brilliant contributions to philosophy - and I would be the first one to admit they were brilliant - Kant was not exactly get-to-the point kind of guy. In fact some of the passages from his works are outright painful to read. Now fast forward to twenty first century. Justin Cronin wrote this book. I suspect he is a great fan of Kant's style as his pace makes Kant's look like a charging cheetah. Look at the page count of this monster; I am sure one would not be allowed in some weapon-free places while carrying it (the book size makes it qualify as one). What contributes to the size? Author's inability to listen to his editor, first and foremost.You will get to see a background of every single character appearing (the tale is of epic proportions, so there are quite a few of them). The said background is usually presented in flashbacks. The flashbacks themselves often contain other flashbacks, several levels deep. In fact I think Cronin created a brand new type of flashbacks - one ones with changing POVs. The most frustrating part: about half of the characters with flashbacks would be killed two pages after the tale comes back to present day. Why do we need a complete background of this book's equivalent of Redshirts??? Starting all the way from his/her birth.I could not help noticing one huge plot hole. I mean big enough to host a couple of galaxies. The vampires could not be stopped by modern military armed to their teeth. Make no mistakes, modern military has some very neat toys with serious destruction potential at their disposals. Look no further than Russian RPG-29 as an example. This guy can penetrate frontal armor of a modern tank, but vampires could not be killed with it? To add more insult to the injury the dystopian survivors successfully held vampires at bay with just bows and crossbows. Some explanation of the phenomenon would be welcome, but none was given. Now with all my criticism of this book you would think it was bad. Take a look at my rating. This is right, 4 stars. The plot was interesting and intriguing enough when it was not dealing with flashbacks. Exactly the same can be said about some characters. While reading I kept asking myself that one question typical for a really good book, \"What is going to happen next?\" I do not regret reading this one even though the problems with it made for a very frustrating read.

In the middle I was losing the will to read on and thought it would do well to wring 3* from me. By the end I give it a hearty 3* but just can't bring myself to offer 4.So, this is a vampire book without the sparkling, the forever sexy trope, or the stalker-horror vibe.Cronin's writing reminded me a lot of Stephen King, though with a more literary edge (which is not to say that King doesn't have a literary edge ... he does, and in many ways it's his popular success that blinds a lot of 'serious' readers to King's writing chops).Cronin writes very good prose. He is rather too wordy for my taste and spends too long getting around to things, but he writes some excellent lines and has a poet's sensibilities.The book comes in many sub divisions but for me it breaks into three main parts. First there is the pre-disaster section where we dive in great detail into the lives of a handful of protagonists while slowly bringing them together for the \"vampire stuff\". The amount of time spent on these individuals makes you sure that they are going to be the pillars of this story. Which makes it rather a shock when you suddenly leave them all behind and start off with an entirely new and larger set of characters far away in time and space.The second section, the colony, is where I started to lose interest. There were just so many characters and so few reasons for me to care about them. Additionally the point of view hops around between them regularly, which I found distancing and made it hard for me to attach to anyone.I found this section particularly wordy and slow moving. Cronin is using these people and their detailed individual stories to indirectly paint a larger picture of the world we find ourselves in ... I understand that. And if it had been half the length with the focus on half the characters I would have been much more taken with it.As it was it was a great relief when things started to go tits up and the roll call began to diminish rapidly.The third and final section is the quest, and here I found myself much more invested. The interest level started to climb along with the tension, and I was pleased with myself to have predicted the existence of something that I felt was the literary inheritor of \"the new warren\" from Watership Down. Even so, the pace was still sluggish and Cronin takes an age to get us anywhere. Some will say that this is a book about characters rather than plot, and that's fair enough. I like character driven stories. I like stories about characters. It's just that in this particular book I found the plot far more interesting than the characters.And finally, the book ends. But not with an great deal of resolution. It's very much a book 1 of a series (trilogy?). I can only think that some of the massive character building at the start of the book, that then vanished down a hole never to be spoken of again, may come to fruition in later books ... I'm looking at you Carter.So yeah... Strong literary writing, a great imagination, but just too very many multitudinous words, too slowly meanderingly point failing to get toingly ponderously paced for this particular reader.EDIT: And one small but crazy detail ... the only curse word they seem to own is fliers. I don't know if the editors were aiming for a PG rating but with so much time taken to build believable characters the dialogue seemed laughably clean and the appearance of \"fliers\" grew steadily more comical.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "Update 5/16: Not a movie but a show now!

Not so fast.The book does get off to a spectacularly great start. But ultimately, it stumbles and staggers under the weight of all the hype and Cronin's inability to sustain the pace and promise of his first 200 brilliant pages.The novel turns on the U.S. Army's botched experiments to breed immortal, indestructible super-soldiers by injecting them with tricked-up serums from a vampiric bat virus discovered deep in the Bolivian jungle, using 12 expendable death-row inmates and an abandoned 9-year-old girl named Amy as the test subjects.Instead, the 12 inmates transmute into vicious, vampirelike creatures who escape and then quickly decimate an entire nation of on-the-run humans with their infectious bites. Before long, just about everyone's dead, infected or controlled telepathically by an exponentially expanding army of vampires, called \"virals\" and \"dracs\" in the book.These aren't your romanticized \"Twilight\"-like vampires, by the way. No, sir. (The message here, I suspect, is that if you're going to play Russian roulette with Bolivian bat serum, don't use convicted murderers in your clinical trials. Just saying.)Although Amy doesn't mutate into a bloodthirsty viral, for reasons we probably won't find out until the second or third book, she can no longer stand sunlight, ages super-slowly, and communicates mostly through paranormal whispers.This is just about where the book fast-forwards nearly a hundred years, to a barricaded outpost in the San Jacinto mountains where a small band of survivors lives under bright night lights powered by dying generators to keep the nocturnal virals away.Most of the colonists have never even seen the night sky or stars.Soon enough, Amy shows up at the colony as the mysterious, ageless girl with viral-like qualities who may hold the genetic key to mankind's survival ---- if her small but brave band of uninfected humans can survive the dangerous journey back to her \"birth\" place in the Army's secret laboratories in a Colorado mountain compound.The first 200 pages of the book are undeniably fantastic, filled with more memorable characters and scenes and tension than most writers wring out in 500 pages. This is seriously good writing ---- the kind of can't-catch-your breath storytelling that propels us forward while demanding that we read every beautiful, perfectly placed word.Then it all starts to crumble, partly because we're introduced to a new cast of characters after the 100-year leap forward who don't carry our interest as much as the ones we've just left behind, and partly because we begin to sense logical lapses in the storytelling.Why, for example, wouldn't the two colonists who discover that the generators are failing convene a big meeting with everyone to brainstorm solutions instead of keeping it to themselves to avoid a panic? (What ---- no one's going to panic when blood-sucking, body-shredding vampires overrun the outpost after the lights go out? Really?)The book has too many ensemble-type characters for readers to become attached to most of them (good thing; lots of them don't last long). And, frankly, they tend to blend together, with indistinguishable personalities and names like Peter and Michael, and are quickly replaced by other generic characters after they're killed or disappear.The bigger problem, though, is that the character we care about most, the ageless girl Amy, communicates only occasionally in frustratingly short, cryptic, paranormal conversations. She's mostly quiet and passive in this first book, when she's even on the page at all. Even the zombielike virals don't leap out of the shadows often enough in a book where they're center stage.It's a curious choice to take the story's two most interesting elements ---- Amy and the virals ---- and banish them to the sidelines for long stretches, or worse, to turn them into one-dimensional, secondary characters.Talk about your buzz kill."}, {"userName": "Katie(babs)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179852-katie-babs", "userReview": "Certain words from various sources are quoted in describing Justin Cronin's The Passage as \"gripping\", \"intense\" and \"epic\". I guess The Passage is considered to be an epic, because it clocks in at close to 800 pages. But by the time I finished reading, I felt this was an epic fail of massive proportions, and unless another book comes along this year, The Passage will be my most disappointing and worst read book. The hype is not always correct, even when a well-known respected author supports a book in such a way you must have it as soon as you can.The Passage begins in the not so distant future, around the year 2014. The first paragraph is somewhat poetic and confusing, where you have to read it a few times to digest it; much like the majority of this book: \"Before she became the Girl from Nowhere- the One Who Walked In, the first and Last and Only, who lives a thousand years- she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy.\"Amy's mother, Jeanette, gave birth to Amy when she was only nineteen, impregnated by a married traveling salesman. Jeanette ends up becoming a prostitute, and one night her latest John won't take no for an answer, and she kills him. Jeanette has no choice but to give up her six-year-old daughter and leaves Amy at a covenant with only her backpack full of clean clothing and her beloved stuffed Peter Rabbit. The nun who takes in Amy is a young black woman, Sister Lacey, who believes God sent Amy to her for a reason. Lacey has been having disturbing dreams. But this is nothing new since Lacey has been a little girl, she has always known, understood, because THE VOICE speaks to her. Lacey knows Amy will bring forth a new way of life on Earth. How does she know this? Because it's stated without any real reason given.Around the same time Amy is abandoned by her mother and thought of the second coming of who knows what by Sister Lacey, Special Agent Brad Wolgast and his partner have criss-crossed all over the Unites States to pick up a select group of inmates to be experimented on by the government. This has come about because Harvard professor, Jonas Lear, has gone into the wilds of the Bolivian jungle along with a group of scientist and grad students on behalf of the USMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases). Less than a month in, Lear has grave news. Through emails with one of his Harvard associates, he tells about an attack by bloodthirsty bats, causing death and sickness in his group. He and the victims are eventually rescued by the US military. Wolgast figures out pretty quickly why twelve special inmates have been chosen. They are being infected purposely with the bat virus founded by Lear. But when Wolgast's boss orders him to pick up Amy for testing, that is when Wolgast knows something more sinister is at play.For some reason Amy is the key to this all. Again, no reason is given and should only be taken at face value. Wolgast will put his life in danger to save Amy. But by then it's too late. Wolgast and Amy are able to escape, but those twelve inmates have transformed into \"virals\", bloodthirsty, hiding in trees, almost zombie like creatures who crave blood. And from some mind hypnosis and hallucinations through dreams, they can control humans and are able to make their escape out into the world. Wolgast and Amy hide in the mountains. From very limited newspaper reports, he reads about the downfall of civilization and how the virals are infecting and multiplying. Amy has changed. She can no longer stand sunlight and doesn't seem to age, but hasn't crossed over as a viral for some reason. Again, no explanation why. There is one last resort by the US government to stop the viral apocalypse. An atomic bomb is dropped.Ninety-two years after the virals have reeked havoc on the Unites States, (there's no knowledge of how the other European countries have faired because all communication has stopped) the remaining humans, who were mainly children rounded up by the US military, have carved a life out for themselves. These closed off communities in the mid central United States have found a way to carry on. The virals only come out at night and attack, so the humans armed with their bow and arrows, and protective high protective fences, keep these creatures at bay. There is a select colony mentioned in the San Jacinto Mountains near California to show this perfectly. But lately everyone is on edge. Their source of electricity is running out and the virals are evolving. And then a young girl comes out of nowhere who some have dreamt of. She is Amy, the ageless, and the only one who can destroy the virals. The people of the First Colony must travel back to where it all began and bring Amy to the one who calls for her.The first section of The Passage will grab hold and not let up. Cronin sets into motion a tension filled tale that you assume will have you shaking in fear. Unfortunately, due to very long winded paragraphs and so much information being handed out, without any explanation, The Passage is more of a mind numbing vision quest with heavy, almost in your face religious and spiritual mentions. I was so bogged down with so much telling and not enough showing. The majority of the time I was very confused. Cronin doesn't give any plausible reasons, and we are just supposed to take it as fact and move on.Most of the characters appear, where we are privy to their backgrounds, much like a biography, and then they disappear, only to re-appear again and bring nothing more to the story. This happens way too often. I couldn't connect with anyone, not even Amy. I felt very much like an outsider as I read. The virals, that should be scary boogieman type creatures, were glazed over in such a way that when they barely come out from the shadows they are hiding in to cause shock and horror were incredibly tame and dull if anything. The overuse of the two words, \"I am\" became beyond tedious. Talk about a mantra that will give you a headache. Perhaps the title should have been I Am instead of The Passage? Amy can hear the virals' thoughts, as I am John, Dick, Harry\u2026 I am the former Walrus, goo goo ga joob. I wasn't gripped, amazed or enthralled in any way. I felt like I was reading one of those literary journals I used for research back in college. 300 pages could have been eliminated easily to make it a much tighter read. In essence, the idea of a new spin on a vampire apocalypse sounds perfect, but the way Cronin wrote it, he has missed the mark big time. The Passage will no doubt become a best seller and will prove that a very lacking book can become an overnight sensation based on amazing hype, the support of much respected industry types, and an expensive marketing and promotion plan from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Sagan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53505099-elizabeth-sagan", "userReview": "I AM BABCOCK.I have never, ever, ever read about the world going to s*** in a more realistic way. This series has the potential of getting into my TOP 5. If not TOP 3. I understand why many people didn\u2019t like the second half of the book; it was because the first part was so damn good that everyone wished it would never end! I wished it too. I stayed till 4AM to finish that first part and it took a while to get used to the sudden time jump. But I came to the conclusion that as it is, the story is perfect. Do you hear me? Perfect. The kind of perfect that isn\u2019t going to bore you even after 1000 pages. This book had everything for me. And the style? Dude, it\u2019s Stephen King level.

I willingly participated in Slap Bracelets and Zubaz and New Kids on the Block, but alas, I waited too long, so that by the time I joined the party, these fads were already in its death throes. This has left me with roomfulls of worthless merchandise that serve only to remind me of my lagging cultural velocity.There have been other phenomenons I have ignored so completely I have no idea what I'm missing. Chief among these has been Harry Potter. While the rest of the world is in thrall, I cannot summon any interest whatsoever. I'll leave it to you to decide whether this puts me hopelessly out of touch or makes me an exemplar of good taste. Lately, I have been willfully ignoring the Vampire Craze. I've never seen an episode of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer; I turn off HBO whenever True Blood is on (which is always); and I've never read a word of Nancy Meyer's Twilight series or watched an insant of Robert Pattinson's catatonic style of acting. Frankly, I want nothing to do with Twilight. On the long list of things that don't interest me are (1) vampires, (2) teenagers, and (3) abstinence. Twilight manages to embody all three. (However, I think that Kristen Stewart's casting is dead on; her pale flesh and blank affect are perfect for portraying the undead...oh wait, she's not undead?). However, I do like two things that Justin Cronin's The Passage represents: (1) post-apocalyptic fiction and (2) sprawling, ambitious epics. So I picked it up. (Carefully, lifting with my legs, since it's a big book). Being a shrewed financial calculation on the part of its author, a graduate of the Iowa Writer's Workshop, The Passage is about vampires. On this basis alone, I assume, comes the fact that it was optioned by Ridley Scott before publication.These are not ordinary vampires, though. They do not wear fancy suits with capes; they do not speak in funny accents; and they do not help you learn to count. Instead, they are a hybrid of every zombie movie of the last ten years. These are blood suckers, yes, but they act more like the fast-moving, high-leaping undead of 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake, and I Am Legend. The first section of the book (the best section, in fact), around 300 pages in length, tells how these vampires were created. This part of the story takes place in the near future, around 2018, in a believably realized world where much has gone to hell: gas is $13 a gallon; New Orleans is gone, the victim of a Category 5 hurricane; we're in an all-out war with the Middle East (there is an allusion to an Iranian-funded massacre at the Mall of America); and the US is latticed by federal checkpoints (by the end of this book, I sensed that Justin Cronin is on his way to being the next Ayn Rand). The US Army, looking for the next generation of super-soldier, starts concocting a virus to make an immortal soldier who is hard to kill, heals quickly, and can fight forever. The Government decides to test this virus on 12 death row convicts and one little girl named Amy. It's a trial and error process. The 12 convicts are turned into uncontrollable vampires who can jump high, run fast, see in the dark, and gather followers with a quick bite to the neck (they kill 9 out of ten, with the tenth turned into a vampire or, as Cronin calls them, a \"viral\" or a \"smoke\"). They are nearly impossible to kill, unless you get them in the heart; if you do, they will drop faster than one of Ghana's soccer players. Not to give too much away, but these 12 escape and wreak havoc. (After all, this isn't Twilight). Most of this havoc is wreaked off-page, and you only learn about it in a series of newspaper excerpts that bridge the first and second half of the book. Suddenly, and quite abruptly, we're introduced to a whole new set of characters, and an entirely different world, many years in the future. This new setting is the Colony, a group of survivors living behind high walls and beneath bright lights. Cronin spends a good bit of time detailing their lives: the tenuous connections with the past; the new lexicon; the struggle to find food and to keep the lights on; and the complext interrelationships of a closed, vaguely incestuous society. (Essentially, Cronin describes the Colony as a Socialist hell, which harkens back to my earlier comment regarding Ayn Rand). Eventually, some members of the Colony leave and embark on a journey, or a passage, if you will. I'll leave further plot discoveries to you, the reader. I came into this book half-expecting one thing, and getting something totally different. As I said before, Cronin is an IWW grad, and the writer of a couple of small, literary novels. In terms of scope and subject-matter, The Passage isn't like anything he's done before. Yet I assumed he'd take a Cormac McCarthy-like tact to what is essentially genre material. That is, I thought Cronin would bring a literary pedigree to the end of the world, as McCarthy did in The Road. I was wrong. The biggest surprise in The Passage is how poorly it's written. We can start with the dialogue, embarrasing at its worst and uniformly unbearable throughout. The most profound and effective things the characters say to each other are exclamations: \"Go!\" \"Run!\" \"Watch out!\" Unfortunately, the characters have a lot more on their minds, which they will speak, at length. The most annoying dialogue trait is the use of the exclamatory phrase \"Flyers!\" You see, even though the folks of the Colony are but a generation removed from a pre-vampire United States, and even though they still have the old f-word (and the rest of the English language), they prefer to say things like: \"Flyers, what was that!\" or \"Flyers, that was close!\" It's so stupid I thought I'd wandered into a parody. Really, that's what the post-apocalyptic future-fighters say? \"Flyers?\" It's something that George Jetson would say to Elroy. Another frequently occuring annoyance is Cronin's overuse of the Proper Noun. It starts on the very first page, with the very first sentence, in which Amy, the immortal hero, is referred to as the \"One Who Walked In\" and the \"First and Last and Only\". This trait is even more pronounced once we are introduced to the Colony. They use proper nouns for everything: their buildings (the Sanctuary, the Lighthouse); their jobs (the Watch) and their history (the First Night, the Dark Night, the Night of Blades and Stars). Again, it nears the territory of parody, like something out of Goldman's The Princess Bride (Cliffs of Insanity, anyone?). This proper noun profusion is taken to illogical extremes. For instance, the people of the Colony call their children \"the Littles\". Why don't you just call them children? I mean, you still have the English language. You still have the f-word. Did that one word somehow get lost? Did you lose it in the dark, on the Dark Night? I also despised the nicknames the characters gave each other. Hightop? Circuit? Are you serious? Is this the It Book of summer, or is it a late-80's cartoon about mutant turtles that are also teenagers and ninjas? And don't get me started with the action scenes. Just horrible. At their best, they're unintelligible and confusing, with no temporal or geographical clarity. At their worst, they read like script directions from a Michael Bay film (in one unfortunate scene, a character drives a Hummer alongside a speeding train, and then leaps from said Hummer onto said train). Cronin also has a bad habit of telling you what happened - for instance, that a certain person died - before explaining how that event unfolded. This technique can be effective at times, but it is much over-used here, and tends to sap what little tension has been built. Does this seem nit-picky? Well, I only noticed these things because of the book's biggest, most glaring problem: it's characters. This is where my surprise is greatest. I thought that Cronin, a literary novelist, would bang out some deep, complex people to inhabit the dread land he's imagined. I was wrong. Instead, you get one paper-thin cliche after another.Every person in the book comes from somewhere else, and by somewhere else, I mean other books and movies. They're all derivative and flimsy and predictable. There's Amy, the Mystical Child (there I go, now, with the proper nouns), and Brad, the FBI Agent with a Haunted Past (it involves a dead child, naturally), and Alicia, the tough female fighter who might as well be called Lara Croft, and Auntie, the Mystical Black Woman who speaks in riddles, and Michael, the Computer Geek, and Peter, the Emerging Hero With Daddy Issues. The advantage of a cliche, at least, is that the person is recognizable. Unfortunately, many of the characters are so vague - just a name - that you tend to get them confused. Even near the end of the book I was struggling to remember the difference between Mausami and Sara. I didn't care about a single person in nearly 800 pages. That meant there was absolutely no tension, no stakes, no peril; I read on only out of curiosity to see what happens. The book reaches it's lowest point when characters attempt to express love for each other. In a novel, I can accept a lot of things on faith, but not the notion that cardboard cutouts can fall in love. There were times when none of this mattered. There were times when the story was so propulsive I actually stayed up past my bedtime to read. Hell - I mean, Flyers! - this is an ambitious world, with its own rules, history, and mythology. That's where the three stars comes in. I mean, despite its pedigree, its size, The Passage can be enjoyed as a summer lark. It also adds some interesting twists on the lives and actions of the vampires, and how they might be defeated. Still, even the good things eventually turned bad, as though the novel had been infected with a virus. Take, for instance, the plotting. Cronin may have failed with characters and dialogue, but he outdid himself with the plot. This is a sprawling work, spanning hundreds of years and two different worlds (the pre-vampire and post-vampire United States). Somehow, though, Cronin ties it all together. Chekhov once wrote that \"If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.\" This dictum is known as Chekhov's gun. Cronin has taken it to heart. There is almost nothing mentioned in this book - an event, a line of dialogue, a character moment - that doesn't somehow payoff down the road. At first, as these loose ends started tying together, I was fairly impressed. Then I realized that things were a little too perfect, a little too seamless. And then, after a person came back from the dead for the fiftieth time, I threw up my hands in disgust. The twists became so predictable that, when they occurred, I laughed aloud. This may be a dangerous world, but as long as you are a main character, things should turn out all right. (In a final, infuriating jab, Cronin uses the last lines of the book to hint at a massacre that, inevitably, will be dealt with in part two of this proposed trilogy. I'm infuriated because I know that this \"massacre\" will not harm any of the main characters, but I will still get the next book to make sure). I really didn't like this book. I'm realizing that now, as I finish this review. I hesitate to drop the ranking any farther, though, because this is a summer read. It's an escape. Right now, there are intractable wars, spewing oil wells, rampant unemployment, a moribund economy, and the ever-present sounds of Ke$ha on the radio. You can open up The Passage and forget those things for awhile, and be immersed in a place that is somehow worse (though blessedly Ke$ha free). I guess that's worth something."}, {"userName": "Stjepan Cobets", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44823204-stjepan-cobets", "userReview": "The book, The Passage (The Passage # 1) by Justin Cronin is a prime example of an excellently written story that the reader draws and draws to read. Although the story dark because the whole world is experiencing apocalypse enormity scale, the book tells the story about people who find themselves in these catastrophic times, who are struggling for daily survival even though the survival conditions are minimal. But in moments in the book I have too many descriptions that sometimes draw attention to the main story, despite everything in the story have tense and the reader does not know who will survive and who dies. In some parts of the book, I have a sense of how a writer literally deliberately kills some protagonists from the book to keep the story from spreading. Regardless, this is a very good book with a post-apocalyptic story featuring vampires - Viral. We should be honestly afraid of what the story tells us because in laboratories controlled by the government and the army who knows what is being investigated to destroy the \u201cenemy\u201d. In this book, one such research has gone catastrophically and the world has become the place of hell overnight. Since in each summary of the book you have a description of the book I do not intend to recount the story of the book, I just want to say that we have to keep it of human stupidity because it is undetectable. The book tells us what would happen if a crazy experiment went out of control and turned Earth into a place where the human species would be food. The characters and story in the book are well elaborated, if you love stories about vampires and post-apocalyptic world, this is a book for you. I would like to recommend the book to all lovers of horror, dystopia and post-apocalyptic science fiction."}, {"userName": "Fergal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7200014-fergal", "userReview": "Marie's review 9/11/12 on Amazon is spot on!"}], "description": "An epic and gripping tale of catastrophe and survival, The Passage is the story of Amy\u2014abandoned by her mother at the age of six, pursued and then imprisoned by the shadowy figures behind a government experiment of apocalyptic proportions.
