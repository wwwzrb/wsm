He cursed the air wing for not trying to get any choppers in through the clouds. He cursed the diplomats arguing about round and square tables. He cursed the South Vietnamese making money off the black market. He cursed the people back home gorging themselves in front of their televisions. Then he cursed God. Then there was no one else to blame and he cursed himself for thinking God would give a shit\".2nd Lieutenant Mellas, an Ivy League graduate, finds himself in Vietnam commanding a platoon. The officers have been thinned out so severely that the Company Commander is a 1st Lieutenant and the Executive Officer is a 2nd Lieutenant. Both positions are normally held by much more senior officers. He has Corporals that have survived a couple of tours in the jungle and at the tender age of 19 are now crusty veterans. He is 22 and being asked to fight a war with babies in fatigues. He worships bush Marines decked out with non-regulation mustaches, dreadlocks, and boots so scuffed they are white. His head is spinning with desires for medals and proving his courage under fire. He is beset by doubts about his abilities, and yet wants to do more than just survive. He wants to be successful. \nThe Author receiving his Bronze StarAs the chapters flip by we really get to see Mellas evolve as a person. As he sheds his state side training and becomes a real marine leader I actually started to like him. More important his men started to respect him. As he experiences more combat and loses men he starts to understand the politics of the war. That change from being concerned about his own future to understanding the futility of the circumstances in Vietnam is a shattering experience for him. Colonel Mulvaney his Regimental Commander expresses his own jaded views about the war.\"America uses us like whores. When it wants a good fuck it pours in the money and we give it a moment of glory. Then when it's over, it sneaks out the back door and pretends it doesn't know who we are. Yeah we are whores, he continued, almost to himself now. I admit it. But we're good ones. We're good at fucking. We like our work. So the customer gets ashamed afterward. So hypocrisy's always been part of the profession. We know that. But this time the customer doesn't want to fuck. He wants to play horsy and come in through the back door. And he's riding us around the room with a fucking bridle and whip and spurs. Mulvaney shook his head. We ain't good at that. It turns our stomach. And it's destroying us.\"The cynicism was certainly understandable when success is measured in body counts, blood trails, and probable kills. They would capture ground and then pull out to let the NVA move back in just so they would have a chance to kill more enemy combatants. It was really a fucked up way to run a war. 'Just tell me where the gold is.''Gold?''Yes, the gold, the fucking gold, or the oil, or uranium. Something Jesus Christ, something out there for us to be here. Just anything, then I'd understand it. Just some fucking gold so it all makes sense.'\nMarine 1967 running under enemy fire.The tension between the splibs (black combatants) and the chucks (white combatants)usually became a bigger issue during down times between combat missions. Marlantes, I felt, told both sides of the race issue with an even hand. He even took us into the decision making sessions of the officers further up the chain, giving the reader a view of the pressures they were receiving and the unorthodox ways they were forced to measure success. Objectives were not clear even higher up the chain of command. The pain, the misery, the waste that are endemic in all wars was even harder to withstand in Vietnam.Helicopters were the life blood of this war and when they couldn't fly for several days food, water, and ammunition became scarce and boys were left to die. It was hard at times for me to read about the circumstances and the unrealistic expectations we had for combat troops in Vietnam coupled with the haphazard supply lines we had in place to give them the basics of what they needed to even do their job. At one point in time the troops go eight days without food and are expected to withstand an enemy assault. \nRedefining victory in Vietnam was a theme of this novel. The men who fought in this war deserve our gratitude and our apology. They were not treated with the honor and the dignity befitting warriors returning from a war that many worked very hard to avoid and were frankly smart to do so. The combat soldiers in Vietnam could not win the war. They could not win battles like the Battle of Normandy or the Battle of the Bulge. They did not return to America knowing that they made the world a safer place. They took the same risks as the soldiers of world war two with so much less to be gained. \"Victory in combat is like sex with a prostitute. For a moment you forget everything in the sudden physical rush, but then you have to pay your money to the woman showing you the door. You see the dirt on the walls and your sorry image in the mirror.\"Marlantes took thirty years to write this novel. He was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals, so he wasn't in the rear somewhere as part of the supply train. I feel like I know much, much more about the Vietnam war than what I have gleaned from other novels or histories. Marlantes takes you into the elephant grass, with leeches hanging from your legs, and jungle rot oozing pus from the cuts on your hands. If you didn't question our objectives in Vietnam and more recently our objectives in Afghanistan and Iraq you will after reading this book. We have to know that when we are sacrificing our kids that it is for the right reasons. They are not and never should be just numbers on a board.

Heartbreaking. There were sections of this book that, honest to God, were difficult to read. If you cannot read war novels, don\u2019t even pick it up. If you are made uncomfortable by vivid descriptions of suffering and of overwhelming human endurance, do not read this book. If out of touch and passionless bureaucratic polices that result in needless hurt anger you, then stay far away. If brilliantly illustrated characterizations of incompetent, careerist, wannabe politician, couldn\u2019t-lead-a-trip-to-the-zoo overpaid and over privileged senior governmental \u201cleaders\u201d makes you want to drop off the grid and go live in a cabin in the woods \u2013 well, you get the point. This book inspires strong emotion.With imagery that reminds me of the writing of Peter Matthiessen, and with brutally honest and realistically complex characterizations that would make Jonathan Franzen proud, author Karl Marlantes has crafted a fictional novel that breathes with life and that tells the good, the bad, and the ugly of a difficult time. Transcending simply a war novel about Vietnam, Marlantes lucidly describes how the military, and the war itself, shaped our society. Matterhorn deals with race relations, class distinctions and the relationship a citizen has with his government in a stirring, but painfully sublime morality play that realistically communicates a time and place but, more than that, paints a striking, and often uncomplimentary, portrait of who we are.Himself a decorated Vietnam veteran Marine, Marlantes has also illustrated a description of his service that, though it objectively deals with the governmental and bureaucratic failings of the Corps, also offers a glimpse into what it means to be semper fidelis; though he states succinctly that a true understanding is unattainable for the rest of us. I have an uncle who served two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Marine, very proud of him, and I have more than once been impressed by the Marines."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 5* of five, but it deserves sixNewly Tarted Up Review!

Play your favorite classic rock song of the era while reading. Buffalo Springfield\u2019s For What\u2019s It\u2019s Worth is always a popular choice. You could use Credence Clearwater\u2019s Fortunate Son. For myself, I'll be listening to The End from The Doors and then plan on going into a full-on Martin Sheen-Apocalypse Now-freak-out as I lay on a bed staring up at the ceiling fan in a pair of tidy whiteys until I drink enough to punch out a mirror and then break down crying. I\u2019ll admit that I didn\u2019t really think there were any more stories to tell about Vietnam that I hadn\u2018t heard. As a teenager in the \u201880s when every male action hero from Thomas Magnum to Sonny Crockett was supposedly a \u2018Nam vet, and movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were coming out regularly, I just didn\u2019t think there was a scenario that someone could come up with that hadn\u2019t been done to death. Plus, I used to have a neighbor who was a Vietnam vet who would tell me some hair-raising stories when he got a few beers in him that had the ring of authenticity that even grittiest fictional stories can\u2019t convey.But Matterhorn had a lot of good buzz about it so I finally picked it up. I got worried in the first chapter where there\u2018s a lot concerning leeches in the jungle. There wasn\u2019t anything there that I hadn\u2019t seen on film or read dozens of time before. Until one of the Marines discover that a leech crawled inside his penis. That\u2019s when I realized that Karl Marlantes may be doing a story in a familiar setting, but he had the knowledge and ability to make it horrible and fresh all over again.Marlantes is a decorated Marine Vietnam veteran with a chest full of medals. He spent 30 years (30 years!) writing this story off and on before finally getting it published. The story centers on a company of Marines circa 1969 with a young and ambitious lieutenant named Mellas taking over a rifle platoon in Bravo Company as soon as he arrives. Mellas may be inexperienced, but he could turn into a good officer. He\u2019s got skills with maps and a feel for terrain and tactics, but his political instincts may keep him from being an effective combat leader. Mellas and the Marines are trying to fortify a mountaintop position called Matterhorn and patrol the surrounding thick jungle. Between jungle illnesses and always being exhausted from the patrols, night watches and the hard labor of establishing the camp, the Marines are stretched thin. Racial tensions in the company aren\u2019t helping anything.But things get much worse when drunken battalion commander Simpson and his manipulative operations officer Blakely decide to use Bravo to try and locate NVA forces they\u2019re sure are in the area of Matterhorn. Simpson sends Bravo out on long jungle recons when they\u2019re dangerously under-supplied and exhausted and when bad weather prevents helicopters from reaching them. When Bravo can\u2019t meet his aggressive timetable, Simpson simply demands more of them and labels them as whining malcontents, and eventually Marines start dying because of the orders that Simpson is issuing.It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve read anything that infuriated and angered me as much as Simpson and Blakely\u2019s treatment of Bravo Company. I spent most of this book hoping that some of the Marines will make good on their threat to frag the two asshole officers. Marlantes\u2019s 30 years work on this really paid off. While Vietnam stories may have become somewhat clich\u00e9d, he\u2019s managed to craft a story that transcends all the slang and trivia we\u2019ve become acquainted with. His Mellas character is probably a bit of a Mary Sue, but considering Marlantes\u2019s background and time spent on this novel, it didn\u2019t bother me a bit.My only complaint is that some of the parts concerning the racial tensions do seem hokey in places. There\u2019s one part where Mellas has a conversation with one of his black Marines, and it comes across as earnestly sincere as one of those old After School Specials. Only with guns and saying, \u201cfuck\u2019 a lot.All in all, this is a terrific war novel that\u2019ll tear your heart out as it teaches you something new about Vietnam. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to do some drinking and stare at my ceiling fan. This is the end\u2026"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "I was in the shit. Karl Marlantes put me there.Matterhorn is a deep and penetrating look within the Vietnam War. It's the sort of horribly realistic novel that can only be reproduced by the survivor of an atrocity. Highly decorated Vietnam War veteran Karl Marlantes had been at work on this book since the war ended. If you ever need an example of an artistic project into which the artist has poured his blood, sweat and tears, you can point to Matterhorn. The book follows 2nd Lieutenant Mellas, a squeaky clean Ivy League kid who signs up and intentionally gets himself stuck in with the grunts, the high school flunkies who make up the front line fodder. Mellas wants to be one of the boys. He also secretly longs for medals and promotion. His desires and inexperience could get him killed. It could get a lot of boys killed and the boys don't like that. Matterhorn is not all doom and gloom from beginning to end. I doubt I would've finished it if it were. No, Marlantes does an excellent job in building the tension. He starts things off light. There is levity through out in its proper place. Then the trouble is escalated. The tension is tightened. You feel the frustration, elation, despair...hope.I hesitated to read this. After all, wasn't it enough that I'd seen Platoon and Full Metal Jacket? Vietnam is a sad chapter in history. Did I really want to revisit it? However, word on the street was persistent: this is great, don't miss this. I'm glad I didn't give it a miss. And neither should you."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54041-michelle", "userReview": "This is the best book I've read so far in 2010. I will say that again: This is the best book I've read so far in 2010. I received Matterhorn from Powell's (Indiespensable #17, a wedding present, I decided) and avoided it for a while, busy with other books, and honestly, looking at it with trepidation because of its considerable size and content. I don't think I've ever read a book about the Vietnam War--would I understand it, I wondered, would it hold my interest? And I didn't understand and it didn't hold my interest for about the first 150 pages. There were too many men, too many military terms, I wasn't sure if I liked the main character Mellas, I had nothing to hold on to. It was just me, Mellas, and a bunch of dudes hanging out on a mountain, digging some holes, thinking about not dying. Then the story picks up. I do think, though I haven't read anything about it, that the author did this on purpose. Mellas, fresh to the field, was also settling in, getting to know the guys, the lingo, the War. Mellas and the readers really settle in during the Trail of Tears op. The men all work together and suffer together and you start to get IT. There are battles. Men do die. Men you HATE to see die, do die (and I don't consider that a spoiler because, hey, this is the Vietnam War, people). But they also laugh (I especially love any part where any man giggles during the book, usually while drunk, maybe on a mystery tour with his buddies). We see these men (boys, really) fight against each other (the racial tensions being especially interesting). We see these men fight with each other against their enemy. And we see these men fight FOR each other. This book...it was haunting and it was heartbreaking and I will never forget it.

It\u2019s quite long, at over 22 hours, but it\u2019s such a compelling story I\u2019d have been happy to spend longer in its company.I'd read some background to the Vietnam war but was really quite sketchy on the detail surrounding the political background and even more so on details of the conflict itself. I've subsequently read up a little more on the political element but was directed to this novel as a vehicle that would give me a \u2018feel\u2019 for the war and for the men who fought in it. I think it does that \u2013 in fact I believe it does it very well indeed.Written by a decorated Marine, the book tracks Bravo Company as they are tasked to undertake a number of scouting and combat missions, all of dubious value and under extremely challenging conditions. It is set in and around Matterhorn, a mythical hilltop firebase close to the Laotian border. The reader is introduced to a large cast of soldiers of varying ranks. There is violence (obviously) and there is the expected bravery and camaraderie of war, but there are also elements I didn't expect to find in such abundance, such as evident racial tensions, decisions being driven by the selfish ambition of senior officers and the way in which missions were declared either a success of a failure based on the body count score alone.It\u2019s a very impactful piece and several times it almost reduced me to tears. It all felt so real, with the combat sections in particular being described in such a convincing way that I genuinely felt I was there witnessing the brutality, the panic, the fear and the agony of it all. This is, in fact, a stunning book. There were times when the sheer size of the cast felt daunting, but this feeling didn't last. As it progressed I got to identify with the lead players, worrying for their safety and rooting for them as they went into battle. It\u2019s an emotional roller coaster but one I'd encourage others to experience."}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica", "userReview": "Like many Americans these days, I have no direct experience of war, so reading books like this one is (hopefully) the closest I'll get to knowing what it's like.As far as I can tell, war is the horrific dark antithesis to civilization. The central aim of what men have done since they squirmed out of a cave and lit a fire has been to make life longer, easier, and more comfortable for themselves. Granted, they often did this at the expense of others (women, differently-hued men, etc.), but better living did seem to be the general thrust. They invented medicines and conveniences and fun stuff like ice cream and motorcycles, and by the 1960s the life span and physical comfort of most Americans was a wonder for the ages. Sure, there were problems -- racial and economic inequality and what have you -- but if you take the long view and compare it to humanity's historical lot, things were overall pretty damn sweet: most people slept indoors, ate nutritious meals, received medical care and education, and listened to terrific songs playing all the time on the radio. Cars and girls looked great and fashion was pretty fine. Given all this, it's hard to understand why this basically comfortable society sent its boys off to die horribly in an inhospitable jungle on the other side of the world, for no real reason that I or most other people can see.Matterhorn conveys the senselessness and brutality of this perhaps especially senseless and brutal war. From the beginning, my mouth just hung open as I struggled to understand why we ever did this -- and then, as I shook myself back to the present, why we are still doing this, and when that got too hard to think about, more abstractly, why we have always done this. The novel is excruciating, painful, and close to nihilistic: it's not really a spoiler to reveal here that nearly every sympathetic character dies. But it's not ultimately a nihilistic book, or at least I don't think it quite is, even though it never wraps things up with false comfort or any pleasant answers. I think ultimately Matterhorn was about retaining your humanity in a relentlessly bleak and unjust and monstrous world, or maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was about losing your humanity but continuing to exist, or not, amid all that meaningless trauma and loss and fear. Or maybe it was a recognition of what humanity is: yes it's penicillin and motorcycles and ice cream and Otis Redding and Plymouth Barracudas and cat-eye makeup and bravery that will make a man die out of love for his friends, but it's also teenagers murdering and maiming each other, being destroyed for nothing when they should be at home with their girlfriends where they belong, because war actually isn't the dark side of civilization, but is instead its inevitable result.Anyway, yeah, kind of a downer. I actually really dragged my feet through the first two hundred pages because it wasn't the kind of book I'd for some reason gotten the impression that it was: I was expecting something High End and Literary with Exquisite Prose, and it took me awhile to realize I was reading a War Novel. Matterhorn is not that high-falutin' lyrical Vietnam Book-Prize Bait -- maybe Tree of Smoke is? I wouldn't know, not having read it.... the writing here does have its moments but is basically workmanlike, which is to say it definitely gets the job done. The landscapes and military details are great; the characters, less so. But whatever, you don't read Matterhorn for its breathtakingly stylish sentences or nuanced writerly tricks; you read it to find out what it was like to be a marine fighting in Vietnam, and while of course I have no way of knowing if it's accurate, it's definitely convincing. Some parts I felt were more successful than others: the handling of race relations felt a bit strained and wooden at times, while the battle scenes and descriptions of day-to-day life were great, and the experience of all these young men being deprived of the company of women just as they became adults was so visceral and poignant that it almost makes me misty-eyed to think of it. What is this world where power-hungry, cynical older men send young virgins off to rot and be blown to pieces on some hill in a country none of them ever would've heard of otherwise?Ugh. Jesus. Well, I don't know how to answer that, and I wouldn't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I read it and I'm really glad Karl Marlantes lived to write it. I feel like I understand slightly more about war now than I did before, which is good even though it makes me feel really despairing and sad."}, {"userName": "Michael ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3724839-michael", "userReview": "I was never issued a draft card. I enlisted in the Marines right out of high school and I was still seventeen. I enlisted on a 90 day delay so by the time I hit the yellow foot prints I was then 18. The Marines agreed that I was too intelligent to be a grunt, so I enlisted on an aviation guarantee and went to school for two years learning electronics. I became an Ace from SACE. I became a radar technician. I saw duty at MCAS Nam Phong, Thailand. The aircraft we supported flew bombing missions into Vietnam almost 24/7. \"They say\" that the tarmac and the structures built upon it were built by the French in the French Indonesian War. They say that the Seabees were in three weeks before our deployment from Japan reclaiming the base from the Jungle. They carved out roads and built the framework for our living quarters that we referred to as Hootches. Ten men lived in each hootch.Nam Phong had several squadrons of aircraft and the many mechanics and technicians necessary to keep our birds flying and bomb dropping. We were all in Japan when we got orders to disassemble our mission support maintenance facility and load it all on C141s and put it all together again to support our aircraft mission against the enemy in the Nam. We....I mean every swingin' dick in uniform labored the most of three days in 45F easy, steady rain to secure our units into the cargo holds of the C141s. We also tied ourselves into the webbing on each bulkhead. We flew eight hours to the jungles of Thailand and had to set everything up again in working order ASAP. Now we were in 110F sunshine.I don't remember how long it took to get mission and support ready. I know guys were dropping out like flies. We had our K rations, bottled water and plenty of beer. During the reassembly process someone yelled that it was raining. Everybody stripped off...there were no women there.....grabbed a towel and bar of soap and took our first shower under the roof of the only A framed building on the tarmac. After those several days required to rebuild our maintenance facility, we were finally told to get ten guys together and go claim a hootch by throwing this huge piece of canvas over the frame the Seabees built. Much of the grouping of men was work related. If you can imagine the tents on M.A.S.H.....well that is about what we had. A hatch....door...on each end down the middle. Five men on each side of that path from hatch to hatch. There was little order in living assignments. The grunts would have remained together as squads. We were air-wingers and we billeted by shops.There were two levels of maintenance at the Rose Garden, the nickname for MCAS Nam Phong. The OMA guys met with the flying crew about a problem with a system. They would pull a \"black box\" and send it through the supply system and immediately install another like black box to get the bird back in the sky. The black box removed from the aircraft would come to the intermediate level maintenance shop. Now I get into the scene by repairing the black box by replacing a module board or a component to get that box back into the system thus clearing my \"in work\" backlog. If our \"in work\" column was empty, we didn't have to remain in the maintenance complex; we could go back to the hootch and phuck off being on call.We worked seven days a week and twelve hours a day. I did not get lucky enough to work 7am to 7pm when heat of the day was canceled by the air conditioned work spaces required by that electronic circuitry. I worked from 1900 to 0700 and by then it was usually already too hot to sleep. We didn't have electricity in the hootches for six months. I brought a small electric fan with me from Japan, but it was useless for a long time until they put generators in the several living areas. I remember each generator powered four hootches. For many months we lived on K rations. They put a 5,000 gallon water bladder in each area. A tanker truck would fill up from the river and keep our water bladders full. Like an above ground pool. We poked holes in empty mess cans and attached a wire handle to scoop out river water and hold the can over our heads to serve as our shower. I also brought from Japan a guitar. I've always been the company troubadour.My experience did not include killing. As are all Marines, even a radar technician, I was also a Marine rifleman. The Marine Corp awarded me a badge that said I was an Expert rifleman. As such I was required to take a turn walking the perimeter with a fully loaded M16 and a 45 caliber sidearm I carried along with my rank of Sergeant. I shot at no one and no one decided to shoot at me. I was quite happy with that arrangement. I damn near died there of dysentery......ain't that the shits.This book kept me interested....it is good......Michael"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "At the beginning of Citizens, Simon Schama's account of the French Revolution, Schama tells of former Chinese Premier Zhou En-lai's response to a question asking what the Revolution meant. Zhou En-lai was reputed to have said: \"It is too soon to tell.\" That's how I feel about the Vietnam War. My passion for history is, in my own estimation, above average. I read about it, I write about it, and I visit the locales, all with a certain fervor that will probably be well-detailed in my wife's court filings for divorce. I have my favorite subjects, my favorite time periods, but I'm not ashamed to be a something of a dilettante. The one area I've mostly avoided, however? America's Southeast Asian excursion. Quite simply, it's too early to try to make history out of Vietnam (in the same way it WAY too early to try to make history out of Iraq and Afghanistan). The ground is still unstable; the wounds are still too raw. In order to create good history, you have to be dispassionate, and that's not possible with Vietnam. It's too controversial. It killed almost 60,000 Americans and a million Vietnamese. It was the focal point of a near civil war. There is a generation of still-living Americans who went to Vietnam, believed they did the right thing, and came home to a scornful county. And there is a generation of still-living Americans who were drafted into Vietnam, believed they were sent there by a negligent government, and came home rueing the lost years of their lives. Like I said, it's too soon. That said, my odd little reading secret is a childhood addiction to Vietnam novels. These books comprise their own sizeable sub-genre in the war novel canon. Here, a comparison is in order. The most famous books to come out of World War II - written by the likes of Norman Mailer and James Jones - were self-consciously important. They embraced big themes, themes so universal that the war became a backdrop for a discussion of Man, Nature, and War.Vietnam novels are different. They are almost all written by vets, with a grunt's eye view of the action. Most of them - based on an informal survey of my memory - use the same basic ingredients: 1. Start with a platoon; 2. Populate said platoon with a young, all-American lieutenant fresh from West Point and new to the bush; a point man of Indian or Hispanic origin who has almost an almost supernatural attentiveness to nature; a black soldier to remind the reader of racial strife; a redneck soldier to be the foil for the black soldier; and at least one soldier who is a little too-excited to be carrying a weapon. 3. Send the platoon and its roster of stereotypes on a long-range patrol. 4. Have them battle against overwhelming odds. 5. Publish. The books following this template range from classic or near-classic to blood-and-thunder pulp. (See James Webb's Fields of Fire, John Del Vecchio's The 13th Valley, Franklin Allan Lieb's The Fire Dream, and Leonard B. Scott's The Expendables, The Hill, The Last Run, and Charley Mike). To varying degrees, these works touch on the explosive politics of America's involvement in Vietnam - whether this was a worthwhile war, a winnable war. To a book, though, they celebrate the bonds that grow between men at war. Karl Marlantes' Matterhorn is a kind of hybrid between the \"important\" World War II novel and the archetypal \"small-unit on a mission\" Vietnam War novel. It owes a debt to Mailer, and to Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried (which it consciously mimics at several points), but also to those lower brow, pulpier novels, with their focus on the thrill of battle. The focus of Matterhorn is a platoon in Bravo Company. To the extent it has a main character, there is Lieutenant Waino Mellas, a young, inexperienced officer who went to Princeton and joined the reserves (we're not reinventing the wheel here). While we begin the story with Mellas, and are introduced to the frightening, confusing world of Vietnam along with him, Mellas shares equal page time with a dozen other featured players. In this way, Matterhorn shares a lot with Mailer's The Naked and the Dead. The characters range up and down the chain of command: there is Colonel Mulvaney, the humanist Korean War vet; Lieutenant Colonel Simpson, the uncaring opportunist; Major Blakely, the sychophantic operations officer; Lieutenant Goodwin, the hunt-minded leader of another of Bravo's platoon; Vancouver, the point man who carries a sawed off machine gun; China, a black revolutionary; and Sergeant Cassidy, the chief racist. If this seems a lot, there are many, many more. But don't worry, the book includes a helpful organizational flow chart (and it also has maps!)The set-up of Matterhorn is a bit of Catch-22-like dark comedy. Bravo Company occupies a hill, codenamed Matterhorn. They dig trenches and build bunkers. Once they finish the fortifications, they are ordered off the hill and into the jungle. After walking fruitlessly around for several weeks, they are ordered back to Matterhorn. There, they discover the Vietnamese have occupied their old positions. Of course, they are ordered to attack. In premise, this is not groundbreaking. The plot too-obviously makes the point that war is deranged and futile, and that Vietnam in particular was a vicious game of whack-a-mole. (While reading this, I couldn't help but think of parallels to the film Hamburger Hill, in which a platoon assaults a hill at great cost, and then immediately abandons it. It stars Dylan McDermott...yeah, that Dylan McDermott). If you fail to miss it, though, Marlantes gets more explicit: So the one probable became a fact. Fitch radioed it in to battalion. Major Blakely...claimed it for the battalion as a confirmed, because Rider said he'd seen the guy he shot go down. The commander of the artillery battery, however, claimed it for his unit. The records had to show two dead NVA. So they did. But at regiment it looked odd - two kills with no probables. So a probable got added. It was a conservative estimate. It only made sense that if you killed two, with the way the NVA pulled out bodies, you had to have some probables. Where Matterhorn succeeds - and to be sure, it does succeed - is in its description of the day to day life of the American soldiers. I don't mean the battles, which are actually the least interesting, least dramatic parts of the novel, but the marching, the sleeping, the eating, the suffering by a thousand cuts. As someone who has dabbled in historical fiction, I know all too well that research can only take you so far. No matter how many hours you spend in a library, there are certain facts you can't reach. Marlantes is a decorated vet (and like Mellas, he went to an Ivy League school) and it shows with the impossible verisimilitude. It's not just the descriptions of the weather - wet, humid, sweltering in the day, cold at night - the malaria, the leeches, the deadly animals, the terror of the night, but the precise knowledge of which MREs the soldiers mixed together to form a palatable meal. Another great success of Matterhorn is its dialogue. Undoubtedly, dialogue is the toughest thing to write. There are few acknowledged masters of the art, those authors who can construct entire books around the conversations of the characters. I'm not about to place him on the level of, say, an Elmore Leonard, but Marlantes' dialogue is a wonderful mixture of knowing slang, military shorthand, and profane eloquence. It greatly enhances the dark comedy that runs as an undercurrent throughout the novel. The only problem I had with the book as it presently exists is an ill advised sidetrip to a hospital ship, wherein one of the characters engages in a poorly conceived, sloppily executed discussion with a nurse. It's a passage clunky enough to lose a star. My real problem with Matterhorn is that it feels like a small piece of a larger whole. And it is. Marlantes worked on Matterhorn for 30 years, until it ran to 1,600 pages. It was published at 566 pages, or about one-third its original length. Now, as anyone who's come this far in this review knows, I appreciate verbosity. But I'm not going to disparage editors. Despite my affinity for the unabridged, I fully understand that a skilled editor can take a chunk of marble and help an author turn that into a statue of a naked figure out of Biblical times that everyone will be enamored of for some reason. In this case, 1,600 pages was paired down to 566, and what remains, while very good, is a skeleton of a classic. There are so many characters in this book that it's hard to keep them straight. You don't get to spend enough time with any of them to really make a connection. This is especially harmful when it comes time for the climactic battle and people you don't care about - but are supposed to - start dying. Even the purported main character - Mellas - is inconsistent. On one page he's super-ambitious, on another, he seems ready to join a peace protest; on one page he's a political in-fighter; in another, he's Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket. I don't blame Marlantes for this, because I think that in his original draft, these character problems didn't exist. I believe that Marlantes probably intended this to be a bit like The Naked and the Dead, in that it'd follow a sprawling group of men at war, interspersed with flashbacks to their lives back home. In that 1,600 page draft, I'm sure I'd get a deeper understanding of the friendship between Williams and Mallory; or the motivations of Vancouver; or the depths of Cassidy, who despite being a racist, also shows traces of decency. Most of this is lost in Matterhorn's present state. The only characters who get extended flashbacks to home are Mulvaney and Mellas. This is disappointing because these brief sections were amazing. They burst with insight and humanity that added the ephemeral breath of life to these fictional characters. For instance, there is a moment when Mellas, a virgin, is thinking about a girl with whom he shared an awkward date: Mellas wanted to reach out across the Pacific and apologize. He didn't remember her name. She didn't know he was in a hole about to die. War was breaking life apart and splintering it, so there were no second chances and all the first chances were wasted.Matterhorn is a very good book: it is funny, it feels real, and it has passages of chill-inducing beauty. Yet, in its present form, it falls short of being a classic. I hope someday that Marlantes, flush with deserved success, will find an editor more eager to shape than cut, and a publisher with the guts to publish a cinderblock-sized novel. Because I will gladly buy that cinderblock."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "\u201cFirst of all, you can\u2019t fall into hating the people you are killing. Because you\u2019ll carry that hate with you longer than you will the actual killing itself. It is only by the grace of God that you are on one side and your enemy is on the other side. I often think, \u2018I could have been born in North Vietnam.\u2019\u201dMatterhorn author Karl Marlantes, August 20, 2010 The Times (London). Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War launched onto the bestseller lists in 2010, when United States was entrenched in two unpopular wars in ill-understood and seemingly hopeless places: Iraq and Afghanistan. Neither of these wars is comparable to Vietnam in terms of tactical warfare, terrain, volume of casualties and mis-treatment of vets by their fellow citizens, but the cultural divisions at home, the politicizing of the conflicts and the anger and sorrow over the loss of soldiers and civilians remain the same. Matterhorn tells the Odyssey of Second Lieutenant Waino Mellas as he leads Bravo Company through the jungle near Vietnam\u2019s border with Laos, just beyond the DMZ. The company\u2019s mission is to secure a remote hilltop base: the fictional Matterhorn. This novel is a living thing. It breathes and pulses, it horrifies and heartens. It is a brilliantly written tribute to combat veterans and a searing examination of the fog of war. Bravo Company becomes a collective Sisyphus, at the mercy of the gods of the Fifth Marine Division. It spins in circles in the jungle, following the quixotic orders of base commanders more concerned with their careers than the lives of the young men in their charge. The soldiers of Bravo Company endure the unbearable: jungle rot, immersion (or trench) foot, man-eating tigers, near-starvation and dehydration, and of course, the horrific results of combat: bullets, grenades, mines and shrapnel cut down the company throughout their journey. The narrative has many themes: the adventure of battle and the camaraderie of soldiers; the value of a well-trained militia in sharp contrast with inherent unjustifiable nature of war; the racial tension between black soldiers and white that brings the conflicts of home to the battlefields of Vietnam; and the truth of military politics - the power struggles between reserve and regular officers and \u201clifers\u201d on the ground and with their commanding officers, who adjust casualty numbers and keep up a pretense of victory to look good to their superiors and to the press at home.Marlantes writes with clarity and authenticity, in a style that is raw, vivid and surprisingly readable. Matterhorn flows with fully-realized characters whom you come to love or revile with ferocity, your heart breaking with each loss. He provides breathtaking detail; the combat scenes are rendered in a minute-by-minute reel and you experience the fear, adrenalin and pain alongside the soldiers. It took Karl Marlantes, a decorated Vietnam veteran and accomplished civilian (Lieutenant, USMC; Rhodes Scholar, Oxford) thirty years to write, rewrite and find a publisher for Matterhorn. Although I would not wish such an arduous journey to publication on any writer, I believe that telling this story \nnow,\n in a new century, to a generation for which the Vietnam War is an anecdote or a chapter in an American History textbook, benefits the book's readers and its subject. Among the most precious and devastating aspects of any war are the soldiers\u2019 stories. No one who has not served in combat can understand what a soldier suffers physically and emotionally. For Vietnam veterans, who returned home only to face insults and shunning, the stories remained locked inside. Writers who record their stories speak for the millions who cannot. In 1977, journalist Michael Herr published Dispatches, an account of his experiences in Vietnam in 1967-68 embedded with platoons; Vietnam veteran Tim O\u2019Brien offered the beautiful and compelling The Things They Carried in 1990. Twenty years later - and thirty-five years after the end of the war in Vietnam - Karl Marlantes reminds us that the stories of young soldiers in the jungles of Southeast Asia are as devastating and relevant now as they were to a generation once removed - our fathers, brothers, uncles and grandfathers - who still live with these experiences tormenting their hearts."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Unforgettable. Marlantes took years to write Matterhorn. Clearly it served as the ultimate catharsis for him to exorcise the horrors of the Vietnam Conflict from his mind. Here is all the insanity of conflict. Here is all the hubris of ranking officers who never visit a battlefield, but whose rise in the ranks depend upon victories in places of no military value. The grunts are pawns on the chessboards of their ranking officers road to promotion. You will be reminded of Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried,\" James Webb's \"Fields of Fire,\" and Winston Groom's \"Better Times Than These.\" At times I found myself casting the young actors of \"Platoon\" as the characters in this novel. It is impossible to read this novel without comparing this powerful narrative to Oliver Stone's cinematic masterpiece. You will find nothing of glory in \"Matterhorn.\" There is only resigned acceptance of troops who follow orders with no logical objective. The bond of loyalty from one trooper to the next is the glue that holds this novel together. Marlantes does not attempt to establish any logic to the Vietnam Conflict. However, he does construct a permanent memorial to the men who fought and died there. As \"The Wall\" serves as a constant reminder of America's sad history in Vietnam, Marlantes' remarkable novel gives flesh and blood and soul to the names of those who line that long black wall."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804133-steve", "userReview": "\"People who didn't even know each other were going to kill each other over a hill none of them cared about.\"This sentence, from Karl Marlantes' superb novel \"Matterhorn\", pretty much encapsulates the war in Vietnam for many people, including some who served there. The war as a whole (its origins and machinations) was more complex, as all wars are, but mostly only to the politicians who started and sustained it. Marlantes, who served as a Marine Lieutenant in Vietnam and earned various combat medals, basically ignores the political aspect and concentrates on the experience of the grunt on the ground. There are no discussions about Communism vs. Imperialism or whether Johnson should have reacted as he did to the Gulf of Tonkin incident; there is only the drudgery of endless patrols, jungle rot, leeches, C-rations, etc. occasionally interrupted by a rather intense confrontation with the North Vietnamese Army. Marlantes, who spent over thirty years writing this book (and could probably cover his house with all the rejection letters from various publishers), centers his story on Lieutenant Mellas, a new platoon commander who has to earn the respect of his men and rally them through the backbreaking work of building new bunkers for Matterhorn, their fire support base that stands just a few miles from North Vetnam. He then has to lead them out after their commander, Colonel Simpson, orders them to abandon it. The company has to trudge through the jungle to relieve another group of Marines who stumble onto them, more dead than alive. In the climax, Mellas leads his marines through a seemingly hopeless assault to take Matterhorn back from the enemy, again on the orders of Col. Simpson. This is a theme that runs through the novel: the idea that a superior officer you've never met can put your life in severe danger mostly, apparently, for the benefit of his own career. Mellas, a college boy, certainly has an interest in his own career, but that gradually takes a back seat to survival as he sees his marines being shot and blown apart with no clear objective. At one point, he admits to his friend, Lt. Hawke, his desire to bring a medal home that will look good on his resume. Hawke replies: \"Look. Everyone wants a medal...It's just that after you've been out here long enough to see what they cost, they don't seem so f**king shiny.\"\"Matterhorn\" runs nearly 600 pages long, and it's well worth the investment of time. It's a stunning epic of a war story, definitely on a par with \"Fields Of Fire\" by James Webb (another Vietnam vet) and Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried\". Its moral, as with most great war stories, is simple, best put by the late journalist Michael Kelly: \"In war there are winners and losers, and then there are the truly screwed.\""}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "If you read the reviews of Matterhorn you are going to see words like moving, riveting, heartbreaking, mesmerizing, masterful, epic, authentic, funny even and always unforgettable.

I also came from the Northwest. He grew up in Oregon; I grew up in Idaho. Without question Vietnam had a significant impact on our generation. It was the overriding theme guiding the life decisions made by young men at that time. From the time I graduated from high school until in 1973 I turned 28 and was no longer eligible to be drafted, there was always the possibility I would be called upon to serve.

Thirty years. Three decades of writing and rewriting; of having hope spring eternal only to be dashed again and again. Thirty years of frustration, of patience and dedication. Thirty years of not giving up.By now you may know the book is called Matterhorn (El Leon/Atlantic Monthly $24.95), and, as its name implies, it is a mountain of a story. It\u2019s also one of the bloodiest, grungiest and most beautiful books you\u2019ll ever read.Named after the hilltop firebase outpost Bravo Company\u2019s Fifth Marine Division builds, holds, abandons and retakes all over the course of a couple weeks, Matterhorn is one of those tales that are epic not so much because of any historical sweep, but because of their humanity. It\u2019s the intimacy of men facing death, and the details of the lives while they\u2019re doing so. Details, I probably need not add, that God is nowhere near.The tale is told from the perspective of a young Ivy League second lieutenant named Waino Mellas, who goes from second-guessing his nearly every move to becoming the kinda hardcore battle veteran platoons of men can and do respect. Mellas and his division are pushed well beyond any reasonable limits of endurance \u2013 blood-sucked by leeches, ridden with jungle rot, hobbled by immersion foot, terrorized by tigers, mortared, fragged, shot at, and, perhaps most viciously, starved and set up to die by a drunk Lieutenant Colonel who seeks only his own advancement. Yet through it all they manage to achieve a certain grace, a grace that can only come from the bonds between men who know too well what it is to experience \u201cthe last hour of that brief mystery called life.\u201dAt nearly 600 pages Matterhorn is, as I said, a mountain of a story. But it\u2019s one so gripping that you don\u2019t mind scaling its heights \u2013 or plumbing its depths. I picked it up in the evening and was finished by noon the next day. And in between I felt all the tedium and fear and fatigue and frustration felt by Mellas and his men. More importantly, I felt the love that held them together, even after some of them were dead.The 65-year-old Marlantes told Kurutz had Matterhorn \u201cbeen published when I first wanted it to be, it wouldn\u2019t have been half the book it is today,\u201d suggesting, perhaps, that it\u2019s those three decades of perspective and perseverance that has given it some wisdom. Having not read the earlier version I\u2019ve no idea. I do know this: he\u2019s come up with something that\u2019s breathtaking and heartfelt and wise beyond anybody\u2019s years.

It is a novel. As in my review from eight years ago, I continue to have a hard time believing that this book could represent reality. It has to be on the far end of the could be true scale. It does seem that the heroics and drinking were a little beyond believability. Because of that I am going to stick with my three star rating.You might find this review interesting of a later book by this author that also significantly deals with Matterhorn:https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/09/18...Matterhorn is yet another book about the war in Vietnam. Did we need another one? But, we are told, this is the one that is realistic, that really captures all the emotions of war. OK. So the book proves that war is hell in all its gore and glory and camaraderie. And did I mention the villainous generals and the endless drinking? The book is set in Vietnam in 1969 near Laos and the DMZ. It covers about three months of war focusing on a couple of dozen people.I found myself unable to believe what I was reading in spite of all the assurances that this is all just like it was. But Marines not having eaten for a week or more and then climbing up a mountain with ropes for five hours? I also found the paragraph after paragraph detailing strategy and tactics a bit much. Maybe I should have skimmed through some segments, but I was trying to get the full effect. And the intensity was really there for me: On several occasions I made myself go on reading in spite of my whole body quivering.So what is the goal of the book? To let those of us who have never been in the Marines know that war is hell and you make a lot of friends and a lot of friends die? Now we know. But if this is what that war was really like, how could we possibly think about getting into another one? I accept that War Is Not Healthy for Children and Other Living Things. My conclusion: we should never do it again.Matterhorn brings the horror and insanity of the Vietnamese war back for those of us who lived through it and introduces it to a new generation. Not to make light of a serious subject, Pogo got it right in 1970 when he said, \u201cWe have met the enemy and he is us.\u201dWhen will we ever learn? When will we ever learn?NB: The first comment is my 'abridged' version of the book: excerpts from start to finish to give some sense of the book."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1120957-sharon", "userReview": "Wow, wow, wow. I want to say a special, heartfelt thanks to every Vietnam veteran. This is a book I'll never forget. As many who served in this jungle have said better than I can, this is a powerful story of so many aspects of war, particularly this war. Everything was so nebulous, I don't see how anyone either managed to fight or came out alive. This is a story of the people of that war up and down the ranks. If you never fought in such a war (I didn't) and want to know what war is like, read this book. If you don't understand why people protest war, read this book. If you didn't understand why Vietnam vets threw away their medals (800 of them reportedly), or why warriors come home with post traumatic stress disorder, read this book. If you don't care about any of this, read this book because it's an important part of American history and should remind us never to repeat this war and what happened within it and around it. For the squeamish, the book isn't unduly gruesome. It is, though, enraging and incredibly sad and enlightening. It is about a brotherhood that can't be truly understood unless you lived it. It is about how it really was, not how the news portrayed it. It's the story of a few good men -- and a few others. I listened to this book on audio, although I own the book. Bronson Pinchot is the reader and he's beyond excellent. Because you shouldn't miss Pinchot reading this book -- you'll get so much more out of it with his perceptive voice inflections and emotions -- and because if you listen while driving you'll miss details here and there -- I suggest reading both the hard copy and listening to the audio."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134922-laurel", "userReview": "\u201cThe day was spent in weary stupefaction, hauling dead American teenagers to a stack beside the landing zone and dead Vietnamese teenagers to the garbage pit down the side of the north face.\u201d (Matterhorn)I wasn\u2019t in Vietnam; I\u2019ve never spoken to anyone about Vietnam who fought in the war yet I feel in my gut that this book by Marlantes speaks to the experience of many. Filled with images of oozing immersion foot, young faces smeared with purple Kool Aid, clinging leeches, young soldiers crawling on their bellies through the dense jungle, I couldn\u2019t relax one minute as I read.I was frustrated by the seemingly heartless and self-aggrandizing actions of those manipulating the movements of Bravo Company, sending them to their deaths, malnourished and sleep-deprived, while they were safe and secure, miles from the action. Every time I read the term \u201ckill ratio\u201d I cringed. Yet the author didn\u2019t present a one-sided view of the Marines; Marlantes gives us a picture of all of the players, the good with the bad. He gives us the human.

Among the handful of truly great fictional accounts of war. The main focus is on a volunteer young Marine lieutenant, Mellas, as he struggles to be a good soldier, lead his men, and suffer the poor decisions of the officers tasked with an unwinnable war no longer supported widely at home. As revealed well in the narrative, there were few pitched battles or contention to take territory, but instead many skirmishes with political goals, including an artificial emphasis on body counts. With so many black enlisted men, racism is a major backdrop for Mellas' challenges to build cohesion in his company. The compelling tale does not glorify war, does not satirize it, or poeticize it, or use action to entertain. It does elucidate the hearts of those who fought this war, their fears, aspirations, and bonds, their courage and their mistakes. It is heartbreaking yet uplifting in so many ways. It should be required reading for all citizens."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223795-katie", "userReview": "From the cover: \"...so authentic, so moving and so intense, and so relentlessly dramatic, that there were times I wasn't sure I could stand to turn the page...\" (Mark Bowden)My book group chose this, not me. And I can't wait to start it, along with the IRS ConstantAudit iPhone app and Fons and Porter's Love of Gastroenteritis.9/16/12: Nine months after I started. I could have finished it by now. I could have had a baby. Looks like I decided to give that a miss, too. The process would have taken about as long, and been approximately as tedious.An English professor in the book group really liked Matterhorn and said it was an allegory, really Parsifal in disguise, or something. If it is, that\u2019s its saving grace. It\u2019s about 60% stilted dialogue and 40% Newsweek-style prose, and it moves about as fast as a constipated Brontosaurus. Well, maybe that\u2019s the point: to portray the awesome tedium of the front lines. Not to criticize, but my admittedly second-hand impression of actual combat has always been that it\u2019s rather lively. I think if I were writing about war, I would try to revise until the six pages my characters spend fighting were distinctly more exciting than the five they spent getting ready to go on patrol. I\u2019d have liked this thing better if I could have told any of the characters apart. Each one had his very own name, and that helped. The black soldiers and the southern soldiers sometimes talked funny (though not in any known dialect). But how are you supposed to get interested in people who have no personalities? Each of them was a foil, a flat photograph from a page of Newsweek. It also would have been better without the endless, minute descriptions of weapons and other gear. (Are those in Parsifal?) Yes, point taken\u2014these men are carrying brutally heavy loads in heat and mud and miserable, enemy-infested jungle. But what is the point of telling me, rivet by rivet, how every ounce of it works? And while we\u2019re on the subject of mud, the author mentions that the men have jungle rot about eight times in the first three chapters, but never goes into details. Come on! Enough with the weapons, set the scene for me!

MATTERHORN. (2010). ****. This is a massive first novel written by an ex-marine who was highly decorated for his services in Vietnam. It took the author about thirty years to write the book. It starts out as mostly another \u2018battle\u2019 book, where brave soldiers overcome the odds against them and achieve their set objective. It soon changes, however, and explores the makeup of the men who compose the ranks of the First Platoon of Bravo Company. The time is 1969, just a year after the Tet Offensive and the assassination of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. The war has become a political football back home. College campuses are still erupting and returning troops are being jeered by anti-war protestors. What difference does all this make to the men on the ground? None. They are ultimately concerned not with the overtones of why they are where they are, they are only concerned with survival. The Bravo Platoon is commanded by Second Lieutenant Mellas, a fresh officer undergoing his first command. His platoon is at the base of a mountain called \u201cMatterhorn\u201d in the middle of the jungle, just kilometers away from the DMZ and Laos. They have been ordered to take the mountain and prepare it to serve as a forward command post and landing site for helicoptors. As Mellas learns more about the men who make up his command, he also learns that they also represent a microcosm of the society that he left back home. There is still racial discrimination. There is still the gap between the educated and the uneducated soldier. There is still the aggressive vs. the non-aggressive individuals in the squads. Most of that, however, disappears when danger ultimately looms and the men have to learn to work together and trust each other in order to stay alive. The enemy in this case is not just the members of the NVA, but the actual country itself: the jungle, the heat, the leeches, the disease, etc. The men finaly get into a situation where they cannot expect support from their main force and have to do the job on their own. This book did not open any doors of perception for me about the whys or wherefores of the war. I don\u2019t think it was meant to do so. It did provide a picture of life on the ground and how a select group of men had to react to it.

It has taken me a few weeks to leave this review because it has taken that long to find the words.Matterhorn is powerful, emotional, gripping, gut wrenching, but most of all, it is haunting. Haunting. Yes, that is it most of all, it is haunting in a way that is beyond anything that I have read for a very long time. I want to thank Karl Marlantes for the experience and the insight. I want to thank him for sharing with me a story that I have no doubt has reflections in his own memory. But most of all, I want to thank him for keeping this war in my mind. Lest we forget, as they say. Vietnam was not a glamorous or politically expedient war (if there is such a thing). We all know the stories of what society did to these Vietnam Veterans when they returned home, and we have all heard the horrible tales of chemical residues killing nervous systems and nurturing cancer. This we know and yet people remember other wars and veterans with nostalgia and Vietnam with indifference. I was born in the 70's, too late to feel the tension of Vietnam, so perhaps I will never understand why this is.There are books aplenty on WW1 and 2, and people devour them readily. Sometimes these wars are romanticised too much and this finds them favour with readers. The Vietnam War is hard to romanticise and so it rarely finds fertile ground in the minds of younger readers. And I suppose I can understand. It is easier for those of certain constitutions to read stories of hope. Stories of survivors. Stories of heroes, of dog fights in beautiful old spitfires, of spies, of Nazi occupation, of secreting Jews out of Germany and Paris, of the beaches of Normandy, the ocean islands of the Pacific. Vietnam, compared to these wars filled with heroes, had body bags and political protest, and men dying in jungles for unknown political reasons, chemicals, resume hunters and officers needing to prove that they had won status in Korea. So again, I thank Karl Marlantes for bringing me his Vietnam. As a place where men and boys from a Coalition fought men and boys from Vietnam and both sides lost."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth\u262e ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth", "userReview": "This book is a vivid account of the Vietnam war. Marlantes deals with the politics of war, as well as the emotional trauma of war. Lt. Mellas is the central character of the book. When the book opens, he is new to the war. And he must prove his salt. Mellas is twenty-two compared to the men in his company that average nineteen years old. Mellas must make split second decisions that will change everyone's fate, including his own.When I was reading this book, I couldn't help but feel completely immersed in the story. I felt I was out there in the bush with these men, because the writing creates such a realistic world around the reader. The journey Mellas takes is one that leads him to guilt, shame, courage and pride all rolled into one. War doesn't come without causalities and, in many cases, the men are their own worst enemy. Mellas grows into his role as a leader, but he also grows into a man while trying to traverse the politics of war."}], "description": "A big, powerful saga of men in combat, written over the course of thirty-five years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran.Intense, powerful, and compelling, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer\u2019s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones\u2019s The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.Written over the course of thirty years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.A graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Karl Marlantes served as a Marine in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals. This is his first novel.
