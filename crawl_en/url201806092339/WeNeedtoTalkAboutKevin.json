As a great writer of my native language said: \"The real story is on the unwritten pages\"; that is, it is the gaps, the pauses and the undercurrents between the characters (which the reader is forced to complete or imagine) which is the mark of great literature. This is one hundred percent correct as far as We Need To Talk About Kevin is concerned. The novel makes us think, long after we finish it.It is not a fast read: even though Lionel Shriver writes beautiful prose, she writes about ugly things. Reading it is almost like self-torture under hypnotism; you don't want to do it, but once you are into it, there's no way to stop.The story is told in epistolary form, through the letters Eva Khatchadourian writes to her absent husband Franklin Plaskett. Eva is the mother of the infamous Kevin Khatchadourian, the architecht of the Gladstone High School massacre. Eva's letters are divided into two parts. One talks of the current time, her travails as the universally shunned mother of the infamous teen: the bereaved parents of Kevin's late classmates have slapped a civil suit on her, which she is fighting in her typically disinterested manner, and visiting her son regularly in the correctional facility where he is incarcerated. The other part of the letters traces Kevin from his conception up to the fateful Thursday.As the story unfolds, we get a picture of Eva and Franklin. She, spirited, independent, liberal, proud of her Armenian heritage and a little contemptuous of her adoptive country: he, more conventional and boringly American. Eva as the propreitor of the highly successful travel guidebook franchise A Wing and A Prayer never wanted a child. But she succumbs to Franklin's entreaties and conceives Kevin. And from the moment he sets foot on earth, Eva's life becomes a horror story.Kevin, through Eva's eyes, is portrayed as so evil that we shudder; as he grows up, his evil nature also expands. To Eva's frustration, Franklin remains oblivious to his son's true nature, trying to recreate some fictitious \"American Dream\" in his backyard. Eva and Kevin face off many times during the sixteen years leading to the apotheosis of his career on that Thursday afternoon, with Eva always the loser.Kevin is an odd child from the start. He shuns breast milk, does not talk (even though he has learnt how to) until he is three years old, and refuses to be toilet trained. He is apathetic to everything, seeming alive only when he manages to goad Eva into a rage. With Franklin, he plays the part of the All-American Child, but mockingly, as Eva suspects.Kevin's crimes are inferred rather than seen: apart from one incident during childhood when he sprays red ink all over Eva's darling maps tacked to the walls of her study, his mother does not see a single instance of his misbehaviour (if we leave aside that masturbation scene with an open bathroom door). But she is oddly sure that in almost all of the \"incidents\" he has been in (and they are many, including one in which his sister is maimed for life), he is implicated: but she is also convinced that her son is so clever as to hide his true nature from all except a perceptive few.So the novel slowly moves towards its destructive climax, picking up speed, and when it occurs, it is much more than we expect. It is a one-way ride into darkness.Lionel Shriver says in the afterword that people who read the novel fall into two camps: those who see Kevin as truly evil and Eva as victimised, and those who see him as a victim of circumstances, mainly an indifferent mother. It is easy to see why. Ms.Shriver has managed to frame the narrative from the POV of Eva Khatchadourian in such a way that the whole veracity of the tale depends on whether we trust her or not. The reader is forced to make a judgement of character and stick by it. In short, how we see Eva and Kevin will depend a lot on who we are.For such a dark novel, more frightening than any horror story, the novel ends on such a sweetly sentimental note that there was suddenly a lump in my throat. Suddenly I remembered that for all his monstrous faults, Kevin is still only a child.This book will stay with you for a long time after you walk away from it. More importantly, it will set you thinking, if you are a parent... which is not a bad thing.For you see, as parents, we do need to talk about Kevin. We have been silent too long."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Overwritten. Arduous. Boring.Seeing as We Need to Talk About Kevin is famous for being such a gritty, disturbing read, I always expected to love it in a sick, twisted kind of way. Unfortunately, it is not what I expected at all. I had to force myself through one overstuffed sentence after another, only to be left feeling drained and dissatisfied.I knew I was in for a paint-dryingly slow read almost immediately. Every sentence is padded out with big words and details that are clearly there to impress, but actually only weigh the narrative down. Damn, it was hard work. And it was made even worse because it's an epistolary novel - I couldn't get past the fact that no one would ever talk this way in a letter. This is the second sentence (and they are all like this):\nBut since we've been separated, I may most miss coming home to deliver the narrative curiosities of my day, the way a cat might lay mice at your feet: the small, humble offerings that couples proffer after foraging in separate backyards.\nHoly shit.Kevin's crimes are revealed in the very first chapter, so it's a struggle to see what we're really reading for. I suppose it is an attempt to show how he got to there - built up through tedious anecdotes from his childhood - but without mystery or action, it was merely dull. We already know Kevin is a sociopath; we already know he killed a bunch of his fellow students.I also had no sympathy for Eva. In fact, I felt a certain amount of anger towards Eva for deciding her baby had an evil agenda (that's honestly not even possible!*) and mistreating him. I don't buy into any interpretations that Kevin's psychopathic nature was something he was born with - it seemed pretty obvious to me that his mother fucked him up from day one. Eva was unlikable, Kevin was unlikable and Franklin's blind defense of his son despite the contradicting evidence was just plain annoying.There was nothing to like here.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Courtney Stanton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155594-courtney-stanton", "userReview": "The pull-quote on the cover of the edition I read suggests that it's impossible to put this book down. That's almost entirely false. Out of the book's 400 pages, the first 300 were kind of like pulling teeth. Creepy, maternal teeth. The last 100 pages, however, were actually and physically impossible to look away from, and the brisk pace of the climax, after so. many. pages. of buildup, actually created a really wonderful, complete story that was very satisfying and which (god help me) made me cry out of a bizarre sense of *happiness* at the end.This book is a series of letters (irritating) written from a travel-writer wife (unsympathetic and irritating) to her separated husband (tiresome and, given 20 seconds and a familiarity with Western literature, leading up to an entirely transparent \"twist\"). These letters start out being about her day-to-day life and a mediation on their slowly decimated marriage (something I really can't relate to), but soon they become All About Kevin. Kevin being their oldest kid, their son, and who recently (in 2000) shot up a bunch of his fellow high-schoolers. It's a post-Columbine book set in pre-911 America, and it's freakishly refreshing to read an entire novel about a national tragedy that neither mentions nor cares about terrorists, threat levels, Iraq, or What's Wrong With America?Actually, it's vaguely framed around the Florida debacle in the 2000 presidential elections, but that event is used to throw into relief how little political issues matter when your family has been destroyed. For the most part, the narrator (Eva) talks about Kevin, why she decided to have him, what it was like to raise him, and examine the ways in which she failed as a mother and a wife.It's weirdly inspiring. I mean, she is a bad mom. Not beating-the-kids bad, but neglectful, cold, self-centered...she is, essentially, the kind of woman who could only love a child if that was all she had left. And so in a way, she ends up raising a child who, in a bid for her affection, will take everything else away from her. It's both sick and touching, and a fascinating examination of how we're supposed to move on from tragedy, how life continues no matter how much you wish it didn't.Kevin himself is perfectly written - both sympathetic and absolutely monstrous. By the time he's 14 and terrorizing his mother behind his father's back, I found myself completely unsurprised by everything as it unfolded. Of course he ended up killing 11 people. Of course he doesn't regret it. Of course. I'm not sure at what point, if any, decent parenting could have saved him, and I like that Lionel Shriver managed to write a lengthy book without answering, or even addressing, that question.What struck me as the most disturbing thing, in the long run - and what's stuck with me most - is that the only thing that seems to scare the kid, and the only thing that seems to at least begin to make him snap out of his narcissistic power trip, is his impending transfer from juvie to the gen pop of a federal prison. The book never gets into it, but I found it deeply upsetting that the prison system is so horrible, mass murderers are scared of it. I kind of felt as if we're supposed to be happy that Kevin's actually scared, but I mostly was just creeped out that the system itself had managed to create something even worse than Kevin."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (aka EM)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em", "userReview": "This book is just devastating ... and devastatingly good. I've just finished it, and had a little cry on the balcony in the bright sunshine, thinking about my mom and motherhood and blame, self-recrimination, guilt and remorse and parental love and the painfully ambiguous, sometimes tortured complexity of it all.And that is underselling it.Suffice for now to say, you might not enjoy this if:- You believe that a lack of maternal instinct or feeling is a character flaw or a moral failing;- You come out soundly on the nurture either side of the nature/nurture continuum;- You believe parents always, at some point and for most things, need to be held accountable for their child's behaviour;- You seek the anxiety-quelling solace that pat sociological and psychological theories and labels offer: post-partum depression, sociopathy, unconditional positive regard.This novel should, I hope, blast through any of those preconceptions--some of which, at some times in my life, I've believed.Shriver turns all of this on its ear, and twists some literary and plot conventions to her own purposes at the same time. She is steadfast and clear-eyed in her determination to dismantle the 'blame the parents' catechism that passes for analysis and explanation of that which is inexplicable, in this case a school shooting and the lives, events and choices that led to it. To do so, she creates characters who are unlikeable, sometimes deeply so, but oh-so-human: even Kevin. Unless you're a sociopath, which I think is one of her points, you cannot help but empathize with each of them at times; hate them at others; give them the benefit of the doubt frequently, too frequently perhaps, which is another.Whether or not you are a parent (I am not), you cannot help but feel that you've been given a rare insight into someone's worst nightmare, because you have -- whatever angle you are viewing from -- and there is nowhere to go to depersonalize or escape it.Shriver sidles up to her characters, cycling through the subjectivity of a first-person narrative from a defense into a self-flagellation into an exposition. Though the jig was up half-way through for me in terms of one of the last plot twists, it didn't matter and didn't detract from the facility with which the author employed the epistolary style, and the emotional punch it levelled.Eva's retrospective self-analysis, through a lens tinged by tragedy, guilt and shame, gives us a perspective into events and motivations both in hindsight and as they unfold, retaining the immediacy and intensity that only a first-person account can provide. It happened but it is never past, because the telling makes it happen in perpetuity, which is exactly how trauma works. Because of who she is, Eva is able to present with alarming clarity that which is unambiguously evil, and therefore that which remains ambiguous is doubly so. Shriver does not let anyone off the hook--these characters are so complex in their humanity, and yet they are also Boomer-upper middle-class shallow, which is never reduced to a cliche. She also never fails to produce horror--infused with the dark comedy to which only its victims or observers from a comfortable distance are entitled (and we are neither)--from sometimes mundane domestic details (an \"eviscerated\" 3-yr old's birthday cake. An exotic pet, a clogged drain and a shaver with an inordinately large amount of hair in it. A glass-eyed antique doll given as a Christmas present.) Kevin's rampage, like Shriver's prose, is revealed in poetic detail. I was sometimes shaking with anger while reading. I would have smashed the water pistol a half-dozen pages earlier, yet when Eva finally did, her remorse at her ink-stained yellow shoe left the justification for the act coloured with her materialistic shallowness and hypocrisy. This scene, one of so many, revealed character in a way that only an absolutely top-notch novelist can ever produce.Have I said? The writing is brilliant. God is in the details in this novel, in which every page needs, probably, to be read a dozen times (not that I could bear it). And there is substance to go with that style: Eva's agoraphobic mother's offer to fly to her after Thursday reduced me to tears, as one mother's unconditional love and courage reflected on the other's--in a mirror, or in relief? Hard to say. There are no easy answers here, for Eva or for us. There is no clear truth or explanation why, a matter on which all sides, including the reader, must--against our human desire for explanation, order-out-of-chaos, resolution--reluctantly come to agree. This review, now, is an incoherent ramble--unlike Eva's self-confessional, bibliotherapeutic letters and the novel itself. It is still a fresh wound for me, and I will need to come back later when I've stanched the flow a bit."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "A novel that's elegant & overly articulate. So much dexterity is on display here (\"Damn what an amazing writer\" is a perpetual thought while reading this), with a prose made by some wizard's alchemy, a talent-filled intuition, and a distinct view that's brutal & uncomfortably honest. Shriver outshines even Flaubert himself: THIS is the core of feminism, of individualism (move over Madame Bovary... you cared more for the idea of love than anything else, anyway, & never gave a hoot about childrearing). An epic book like \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" is rare, yeah. I can see this as some rather strikingly beautiful monster composed of the few scary parts from Ira Levin's \"Rosemary's Baby\" and the more ominous tones of \"The Omen\". It's a modern psychology (dissected with words so carefully chosen, both intellectual and to-the-core precise) that deconstructs a past for the sake of...something. I won't tell. This one has a DYNAMITE ENDING that will rattle you, and then some. It is, truly, pretty much everything you'd ever want in a book (Shriver's account is WAAAAAY more compelling than Philip Roth's Pulitzer darling \"American Pastoral\", & they share the theme of the American dream-gone-bad, as parents are betrayed by their own American flag-toting offspring).Recommended 100%. It's a Grade A+ brilliant, contemporary, and (even!) historically-relevant novel... which BLEW ME AWAY completely."}, {"userName": "Kiersten", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/659087-kiersten", "userReview": "I did not like this book. Honestly, what was to like about it? The topic is horrifying, the characters are hateful (and not just the characters that commit mass murders) and the writing style is the worst of all. From the first page I was SO irritated by the writing. I'll bet that the first purchase Ms. Shriver made after finding a publisher for this book was a new thesaurus. I'm positive that hers was absolutely worn out. It was like, \"Hi! Let's see how fancy we can sound!\" Especially for a book that is supposedly made up of letters written to one's estranged husband. The letter format was an especially poorly-chosen literary device. I get that we, the reader, needed background, but did Eva really think that her husband needed to be reminded, among other things, about all the random little details of his childhood? They were his memories, after all. Why did she need to repeat them to him, and in such an arrogant, condescending way? And the lists of other school shootings. Blah. I became extremely tired of reading about those as Eva ticked them off. I felt like I was hearing a lecture or a compilation of NPR news stories. But speaking of arrogant and condescending, here's another problem that I had with this book. I happen to reject the idea that the parents are 100% responsible for their children's failures or successes. Some children have crappy parents and turn out great, and I've seen the opposite happen as well. However, if any parent could cause a child to go crazy/homicidal, it would be this woman. Hello, being bored=not a good reason to have a child. (Did I really need to say that?) Eva was mean, negative, and overbearing throughout the book. And again, I realize that with the letter format, we are only getting the viewpoint of one, limited, character, but that's not an excuse for making the characters so completely one-dimensional. Kevin was evil, Celia was demure, Franklin was naive, Eva was obnoxious, etc. Finally, the question of the big reveal. And I actually do have a question about this. It was pretty obvious what was going on, that there was going to be a big reveal, after about page 3 of the book (and I'm not talking about the fact that Kevin killed his classmates. That was not meant to be a secret. It was written in the description on the back of the book). My question is this--was this just poorly written so that what was meant to be a big reveal was, well, not? Or did Shriver make it obvious on purpose, in order to make it more awful to read--we knew what was going to happen, and we didn't want to read it, but we were going to have to and were coming closer to it with each page. I'm going to give Shriver the benefit of the doubt on this one, because if that's what she meant to do, it worked."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332648-jenny", "userReview": "Some readers really don't like this book and I'm not entirely sure why.Maybe it's because I'm not a mother and I did find it believable that Eva doesn't love her son completely. Maybe it's because I enjoy the big words that were used in the letters and found it believable that she would write this way.Maybe I'm a sucker for good endings and this one ended with a bang.I think the writing was superb and despite it being a hard book to read (the incident with the maps was particularly brutal), it was worth it. I think this dealt with the issue of school killings much more effectively than Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes. The character of Kevin did come alive for me and he was believable. I didn't even think that counseling might be an option because Franklin 100% believed that his son was fine and probably would have opposed Eva if she had suggested it. Just like she never thinks about them divorcing, she also never considers giving her son help.

It did a great job of confirming a few truisms, maternal instincts are not a given, some children are just born bad, and the worst mistake a couple can make is to allow a child to divide them. It\u2019s the story of Kevin, a lethal mix of nature and poor nurturing resulting in the child from hell. Yet it\u2019s the character of his mother Eva that I found the most disturbing. Totally self-absorbed, high-octane critical; full of discontent, no wonder she\u2019s completely unable to form healthy relationships with anyone including the husband she purports to adore. Ergo a neurotic son. It\u2019s not as sensationalist as I expected, this is a terrific book. Would I recommend it? Oh yeah, but with disclaimers; it could easily offend and it\u2019s horrific, so read at your own risk. It will make you think and it will stay with you, \u2018Rosemary\u2019s Baby\u2019 for the 21st century only way scarier because it\u2019s based on reality.

I only know that this book is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read, and in all likelihood, will ever read.How can I so deeply love a book that is this agonisingly ugly??---Full review---I knew before I started that reading this was going to be hard. We Need to Talk about Kevin is listed as one of the most disturbing books on GR. So, in an attempt to limit the coming agony, I made a few rules:RULE 1: Do not get emotionally involved.RULE 2: Do not take sides.RULE 3: Do not dwell on the disturbing parts.A hundred pages later, when I put the book down and went to bed only to replay and obsess over Eva\u2019s commentary in my head, I realised my rules were long broken.I got emotionally involved. I always do. I wish I could say that Eva's so horrible that I couldn't relate to her but a teeny-tiny part of me did, especially at the start. Crying babies terrify me and I\u2019ve always harboured a lot of reservations about having kids. I\u2019m not saying I never want to have kids; that would be a stupid thing to say considering I wasn\u2019t even an adult four years ago. But I\u2019m the kind of girl who gets a panic attack when she's asked to babysit her hyperactive nephews.I took sides. Right from the start, I unconsciously sided with Eva. True, the way she thought of her son repulsed me at times, but I felt Kevin\u2019s actions were more repulsive. For me, Kevin was quintessentially evil, and Eva was the poor woman who had the misfortune of bearing him. The fact that she didn\u2019t want to have him in the first place just seemed to make her more of a victim.As for not dwelling on the disturbing parts...well, there are NO PARTS. The book in entirety is a systematically harrowing tale with no escape. The only way to skip the distress would be to stop reading the book itself, and while that thought did cross my mind, the bibliophile in me couldn\u2019t stay away. So I persisted. I bore the mental anguish. I let Eva\u2019s commentary drill into my brain.And that's my answer to why I love this ugly, ugly book. It caused me to recoil in horror so many times, but also made me come back to it every single time. Every minute I was reading, I wanted to stop; yet when I put the book down, I wanted to pick it up again. Like being addicted to something unpleasant and craving it, even when that voice in your head begs you not to.This is an uncharacteristically long review, but there\u2019s one last thing I want to add. This book left me with a question that\u2019s bothered me for days. Like I said, I\u2019ve always been on Eva\u2019s side, but the last 4 pages made me reconsider. I mean, whatever Kevin did is inexcusable and gruesome, and I still feel for Eva, but who\u2019s the culprit and who\u2019s the victim? What\u2019s the cause and what\u2019s the effect?Is Eva such a cold mother because Kevin is who he is? Or did Kevin become who he is because Eva is such a cold mother?In the end, who do we really need to talk about? Kevin? Or Eva?I\u2019ve ruminated over this question for days, but I feel it\u2019s best to leave it unanswered. Because whatever the truth may be, it\u2019s bound to be hideous.\n\u201cIt must be possible to earn a devotion by testing an antagonism to its very limit, to bring people closer through the very act of pushing them away. Because after three days short of eighteen years, I can finally announce that I am too exhausted and too confused and too lonely to keep fighting, and if only out of desperation or even laziness I love my son.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "I've started this review 6 times now, and each time, I've deleted it because it doesn't quite convey the right thing. I think the problem is that I'm not sure just what that thing is. But one thing I do know is that I love books that make me feel like this... that \"I don't know what I need to say but I need to say something, to talk about this with someone because this book won't keep quiet in my mind\" feeling. I guess it's lucky that this was chosen for our latest group read then, because I filibustered there with every jumbled, messy, half-formed thought that my tired-because-I-stayed-up-until-nearly-2am-with-this-book-then-worked-a-full-8-hours mind could think of... Because this book won't keep quiet in my mind. I finished it last night around 1:30am, tears streaming down my face, hurting for everyone and furiously heartbroken over something so unnecessary and so seemingly unavoidable as what was depicted. Then I slept, and I dreamed about this book, with hazy, distant figures without names or faces, but bigger than life aspects. It's rare that I dream about books. It doesn't matter if I read it up until the minute I drop off; I only dream about a book I'm reading, or have read if it pulled me into its world first. I dream about the books that touch my soul. *cue dramatic music*This book was just... wow. If I were to nitpick anything, it would be that Eva's pen wandered a tiny bit too much into the outside world. I wanted to see her world, the world of her family, or her lack thereof. It took a little bit to get there, and for a while, there were hints but the narrative meandered along in its own time. But oh my, once it got going, it really got going. I don't think it was just my last minute mad dash to read this the day before my bookclub meeting that helped me to read 75% of this book in one night after work... it was unputdownable. Once I glimpsed this family's world, I couldn't look away. There is... so much to talk about in this book. And I don't think that I could even attempt to do the topics or themes any justice (as I didn't in my bookclub, not for lack of trying). This is a book that begs to be turned around to the beginning again and immediately re-read. It's like one of those optical illusions. At first, the picture is simple, but then once you see the hidden picture within it, you gain a new appreciation for the whole. This book was beautifully written, insightful, questioning and heartbreaking. It was nothing at all like I expected, and even guessing the things that I guessed (which turned out to be true), it didn't make the impact any less. This book was so incredible at making me sympathize and empathize with each person's perspective, though we only see these through Eva's brutally honest memory, that it was impossible for me to lay blame anywhere, even though the potential for assigning blame was huge. This was expertly executed (pun intended), and it is not one that I will forget any time soon."}, {"userName": "Nicola ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2461560-nicola", "userReview": "I don't even know where to start with this one. The book was basically a whole load of nothing. It's the absolute definition of ''trying too hard.'' I don't care how many big words Shriver knows the meaning of. Throwing them in so often only made for muddled, disjointed, boring to read sentences. There's no story. We know from the beginning that Kevin has shot a bunch of students dead, and then Eva goes on to tell random, often exaggerated stories from his childhood leading up to the shooting. The characters are so very unlikable. Eva decides from day 1- literally- that Kevin is evil and out to get her. He's only a few minutes old when she decides he's plotting against her. When Kevin is 18 months old, she sit in front of him and calls him a ''little shit.'' The level of paranoia displayed by Eva is absolutely ridiculous- it's no wonder Kevin took a dislike to her as he grew older.Kevin was no better than Eva. He's a horrible piece of work, with no sympathy for anyone. It's clear he's a very disturbed person, but I honestly believe half of it was from trying to get some sort of maternal reaction out of his mother, some sign that she actually cared about him in the slightest. Franklin was just plain irritating. He lived in his own little world where his son was perfect- despite the fact that he seriously injured his little sister for a start- and is convinced they have a ''great relationship'' when all along Kevin clearly couldn't care less about his father. I very much disliked the ending. All the characters were suddenly revealed as the complete opposite to what they'd been for the other 400 pages, and I felt a little cheated. There was no need to strive for a somewhat happy ending, when the rest of the book was already very disturbing."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "At first, this book seems to be about a mass-murdering Columbine-style kid and whether or not he was born that way or his mother, who didn't love him, made him that way.

The character of Kevin, the teenage murderer whose mom narrates the epistolary novel, was so disturbing and harrowingly well-drawn, that I think it caused some sort of chemical reaction in my brain. He gave me nightmares. I swear whenever I picked up the book gray clouds covered the sun.In a series of letters to her estranged husband, narrator Eva dissects her family's life, from the decision to have a child to the day her son locked 9 classmates and a teacher in the gym and used them for target practice. Were Eva's ambivalent feelings about motherhood part of what made Kevin into such a monster, or are some people simply born evil? In the case presented in this book, I'm going to have to lean towards the latter. Even as an infant, Kevin is a solid misanthrope and shows a disarming talent for manipulation.This question, which I think is at the heart of the book, is not as clearly answered as I'm making it out to me. In fact, Lionel Shriver, in writing about readers' responses to this work, says she has seen two camps: \"One camp assesses a story about a well-intentioned mother who, whatever her perfectly human deficits in this role, is saddled with a 'bad seed' evil from birth whose ultimate criminality only she seems to perceive but is helpless to prevent...\"The second camp of readers appears to have read another novel entirely: about a mother whose coldness is itself criminal and who bears full responsibility for her son's rampage as a teenager.\"Shriver concludes: \"I have found this division gratifying.\"I definitely recommend this visceral reading experience. One of the quotes on the back calls it \"A slow magnetic descent into hell that is as fascinating as it is disturbing,\" and I think that's pretty accurate. I'm interested to hear what people with children think of it from a parents' perspective. Because I tell ya, it sure makes motherhood seem terrifying."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "A disturbing and gruesome epistolary novel that is not an easy read.

It's a big taboo, and all that.For my money though, bypass these poor excuses and go straight to nettyflix or where you get your movies and rent IT'S ALIVE!This is a snappy underrated movie about a baby who is frankly unloveable because he tends to slaughter everyone within a 25 foot radius of himself. He's very difficult to get close to. Because he keeps scuttering away into the sewers.So Kevin, of whom we must speak, is this dweeby young sociopath and yes, there are such people, and we should talk about them, yes, that's true, but not - please - not like Lionel Shriver talks about them.

I appreciate the author's attempt to get into the whys and wherefores of teenage mass murderers, but I'm not sure the book deserves the attention it's gotten. While it definitely presents the story behind one such (fictional) criminal, I don't believe that Kevin's story is every school shooter's story. I think the relationship between mother and son (a son trying desperately to get a reaction from a mother who not only was ambivalent about his birth, but doesn't like him as a child either) is overshadowed by the horrific detals of the larger story. The nuances of the relationship -- and the truths about how far a child will go to gain his parents' attention -- are lost in the carnage. A sidenote on the writing -- I dislike having to work so hard to read a book. I have trouble believing that an ordinary reader made it through this novel without a dictionary in hand. What's with the convoluted sentence structure and made-up words, and why did the author insist on using phrases such as \"lambent joy,\" \"\"immediate rapacities,\" and \"alien argot?\" And this, from a woman who supposedly wrote travel guides aimed at the average college student? I think not. All in all, a gripping story, but the sensationalism of the crime obscures the deeper, more accessible meaning."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "I don't think a book has ever made me teary-eyed before! I have been known to sob while watching a movie but haven't actually while absorbed in a book. We Need to Talk About Kevin was it \"Impossible to put down\" as suggested on the front cover? No, out of the 400 pages of this book, I thought that the first 200 or so pages were extremely hard to get through because this was not an easy read for me. I did not particularly like the authors writing style, choice of words used, and all the details crammed together in a sentence. It was quite exhausting at times. The last 100 pages were actually hard to put down. After so many pages of build-up the climax was fast-paced and I felt that it was a complete, satisfying read in the end.The book was told in a series of letters by Kevin's mom, Eva to her husband, Franklin. Most of the letters Eva talks about Kevin, why she decided to have him, what it was like raising him, ways that she might of failed at being a mother, and confessions of her own about Kevin.So was Kevin born that way or was he made that way because he didn't have a mother that wanted, loved or nurtured him?That is the question you will be asking yourself throughout the novel as you read. It was a thought-provoking, slow-paced, disturbing, emotional, and difficult read but I think it was well worth it. I was completely satisfied with the very emotional ending.

Boy was I wrong. I don\u2019t even know where to begin. Basically every character in this book is an intolerable asshole. You're supposed to sympathize with them, but it's impossible because they are all such horrible people. The whole escapade turns in to a frustratingly unsatisfying schaudenfraud.Chapter after chapter contains nothing but the characters going OUT OF THEIR WAY to make you hate them. I hope this was intentional because I don\u2019t think anyone could write about people so blatantly unlikable without catching on at some point. And Christ, the writing style is even worse. This book reads like someone who had one window open on Microsoft Word and the other on Thesaurus.com.

First of all, she writes novels that should be gimmicky, but are not. In  The Post-Birthday World she employs a doubled narrative that splits in two at its heroine's defining moment of choice/will/agency, what have you. In  We Have to Talk About Kevin she goes for the epistolary form. But in both cases, the \"device\" is perfectly matched to the content, like an igloo (form follows function y'all). The meaning of the novel is bound to its form. Second of all, her prose is fucking delicious. Her language endlessly delights me; it is crafty, artful, funny, acute, and heartbreaking. Third, she writes with more nuance than almost any other contemporary writer I've read (that's you,  Kazuo Ishiguro) about the nuances and complexities of human psychology, especially in terms of how people relate to/react to each other. Fourth, no easy answers. Lionel Shriver's work is bold and often crushingly sad, because she is brave enough to explore the various unhappinesses of life on earth without offering pat answers as to its causes. Fifth, she writes about women, messy, arrogant, willfull, meek, submissive, brilliant, dim, WOMEN. God, she's so good.As far as  We Need to Talk About Kevin goes, I could not put it down. The premise is straightforward enough: the mother of a Columbine-style teen-aged killer (the titular Kevin) writes a series of letters to her husband in which she attempts to hash out the thorny questions that their son's rampage has raised vis a vis responsibility for his crime. Eva's letters constitute an amazing dissertation on the requirements of motherhood and its attendant mythology (I think I like reading Shriver's work so much in part because I always come away from it feeling more normal about my own gender fueled ambivalencies). The book dares to suggest the possibility that some people are born bad, are, from conception, simply irredeemable. It also doesn't shrink from microscopically dissecting Eva's faults, and by so doing, fingering her as culpable. As to who or what is ultimately to blame for Kevin, suffice it to say Shriver does not provide the reader with a clear answer come novel's end. Instead, she breaks your heart."}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "MIO FIGLIO \u00c8 UNA TERRA STRANIERALa signora Shriver nasce Margaret Ann, poi a 15 anni decide che quel nome non le piace e che per lei un nome maschile \u00e8 sicuramente pi\u00f9 adatto: forse per protestare contro una famiglia eccessivamente religiosa, forse perch\u00e9 troppo spesso si sentiva definire \u2018maschiaccia\u2019. Cos\u00ec, sceglie e adotta per s\u00e9 il nuovo nome di Lionel - quasi una dichiarazione di guerra.La mamma (Tilda Swinton) con Kevin (Ezra Miller) nel film omonimo di Lynne Ramsay, 2011.Lionel Shriver \u00e8 consapevole del patto che sottoscrive col lettore: ti porter\u00f2 in una terra e ti far\u00f2 fare un viaggio che, a te, mio lettore, sembrer\u00e0 autentico, mentre invece \u00e8 frutto della mia fantasia.La storia di Kevin \u00e8 nutrita dei e dai fatti di tanta cronaca nera, di quegli episodi che si raggruppano sotto la stretta etichetta di \u201cadolescenti violenti\u201d, che fanno la gioia di pessimi esperti e biechi talk show.Se la storia \u00e8 vera, inventata di sana pianta, assemblata, modellata su fatti esistenti, tutto questo ha poca importanza: ci\u00f2 che conta per me lettore \u00e8 che la storia sia credibile. Shriver sicuramente riesce a rendere le sue 480 pagine magistralmente verosimili e credibili.Il pap\u00e0 (John C. Reilly) con Kevin.Chi sono io lettore, sono Eva o sono Kevin? Posso restare a guardare o devo prendere parte, e schierarmi? Pensieri ed emozioni viaggiano a mille leggendo queste pagine, impossibile restare indifferenti, restare a guardare, si \u00e8 trascinati in una centrifuga che non lascia scampo: molti di noi sono genitori, tantissimi di noi sono figli, e tutti siamo nati \u2013 tre esperienze base che Shriver sa come usare e manipolare.Alla lunga, la prosa di Shriver risulta un pochino troppo piatta: neppure una sottolineatura, o un appunto, una nota \u2013 scorre identica a se stessa, e qualche taglio qui e l\u00e0, personalmente, l\u2019avrei introdotto. Alla lunga, Franklin, il padre, sembra un po\u2019 troppo cieco e sordo, e non si capisce come faccia Eva a esserne ancora cos\u00ec innamorata. La stessa Eva cresce sempre pi\u00f9 nella direzione del classico \u2018grillo parlante\u2019, si staglia sempre pi\u00f9 come persona che su tutto ha un\u2019opinione e che mai rinuncer\u00e0 a esprimerla a chiare lettere.Kevin.Ma Shriver non fa sconti: se Eva sia o meno la madre nella quale identificarsi e specchiarsi conta relativamente, perch\u00e9 Eva \u00e8 la madre di tutte le madri.E Kevin \u00e8 la madre di tutti i figli, con la sua dilagante ferocia, la purezza della sua rabbia, l\u2019abisso della sua infelicit\u00e0. Ah, Kevin, perch\u00e9 hai scelto proprio tua madre come pubblico del tuo gesto? Ed esiste qualcuno che avrebbe potuto fermarti in tempo? Quanto hai sofferto nei tuoi sedici anni? Fino al punto di moltiplicare la sofferenza e distribuirla a pioggia di sangue?Da questo libro, una bravissima regista inglese, Lynne Ramsey ha tratto un film: ha impiegato anni a scrivere la sceneggiatura, l\u2019ha modificata secondo le esigenze del budget, e alla fine ha realizzato un film dallo stesso titolo, che \u00e8 semplicemente magnifico, stupendo, devastante, come e oltre il libro. Un adattamento superbo, che conserva intatta tutta l\u2019anima del libro, rimedia alle sbavature del romanzo, e crea un\u2019opera a se stante, che io avvicino ai capolavori. Dove i fatti mostrati sono reali, o forse immaginari, sempre difficile capirlo, perch\u00e9 siamo dentro la testa di Eva. Tilda Swinton \u00e8 perfetta nella parte di Eva \u2013 e Kevin \u00e8 indimenticabile.PSContinuando a pensare a madri presunte 'cattive', a depressioni post parto, a madri non accoglienti d'istinto,

pagine perch\u00e9 l'argomento \u00e8 ostico, tab\u00f9, scivoloso - ma, semplicemente, rifiuta le cose brutte e fatte male, e invece accetta e apprezza quelle belle e fatte bene."}, {"userName":

mother in a profound way, if not for his other hapless victims including his father and little sister. This is what disappointed me and pissed me off, because it felt like a cop out. After writing a convincing and chilling portrayal of a child sociopath, Shriver now seems to backtrack. It's like she wants it both ways -- Kevin a born sociopath AND a misunderstood teen -- a by-product, nay victim, of his mother's inability to love him unconditionally. This duality might work stylistically if your intent is to stimulate the nature vs. nurture debate, but I think it weakens the story considerably. To have Kevin visibly shaking at the daunting prospect of adult incarceration, to cling to his mother in a helpless childlike embrace, is so OUT OF CHARACTER for everything that's come before as to make it meaningless.What did chill me -- and maybe this was the point all along -- is Eva's final acceptance of her son now that the worst has happened. The fact that she has a room waiting for him when he gets out of prison did not strike me as a mother \"standing by her child no matter what\" (finally!) but that Eva's mind had broken and this was no more than a twisted, gothic grotesquerie to claim the only family left to her. That she did not whisk her daughter away from the monster in her midst WHEN SHE KNEW what he had done to her sickened me. That Eva should now forgive the unforgivable when her daughter's body lies cold in the ground is unfathomable to me and left me with the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight up.

It is like you are peering right into someone\u2019s soul, maybe someone you know and maybe you don\u2019t always like what you see. Still there are things to like here, things that every one not familiar with this tale would recognize. Good things. Sadly they are pretty much obliterated by the darker themes of this story.It can be both uncomfortable and compelling, to think about the private thoughts of others. I think we would all be protective of many of our innermost thoughts, we all keep certain fears, pleasures, observations and feelings tucked away, not hidden exactly, just not on display. They\u2019re ours.Eva\u2019s thoughts, feelings and observations are on display here, as she takes us on her own personal, parental story. And every reader listening knows that Eva\u2019s fifteen year old son Kevin murders nine people at his high school, no spoiler here, it says so on the back of the book. So yes, it is quite a compelling story. Still this can be a difficult and tedious experience, one that explores the nature versus nurture questions that surround all heinous crimes and their perpetrators. So we meet Kevin and say what you will about Eva and his relationship I confess that there were many times I simply wanted to slap some sense into her husband Franklin. Then again how reliable is this narrative? It is Eva\u2019s after all.

They were clearly partly cathartic and partly an attempted analysis of where (if anywhere) to apportion blame. Eva was an intelligent and educated woman, familiar with the Nature v. Nurture controversy and many psychological disorders, especially of children. But it was also a cry for help, so why was it unanswered?Personally I guessed the reason for this about a third of the way through the book, and expect others would too, though I doubt whether this was intentional on the part of the author. It had already been mentioned that teenage killers such as Kevin tended to kill close family members or themselves too. But when the \"shock\" came very near the end of the book I realised just how deliberately this fact had been hidden. For the patricide not to have been mentioned in Eva's retelling of her many encounters and musings was just unrealistic. Ultimately this was irritating; the reader feels manipulated. From reading what apparently is a serious and believable portrayal of a nightmarish situation, this obscuring of a hugely important fact just seems like a cheap trick. I also find it hard to credit that the couple did not even seem to consider alternative methods of child-care. Eva loved her work; her husband adored Kevin, never believing in his malevolence. They were both in their own private hell when Eva stayed at home with the child. Wouldn't any sane person living in the society they did, at the time they did, at least have considered swapping roles? And would Eva really have slotted quite so happily into the nurturing/cooking/cleaning/50's housewife model?

In her 2010 novel, So Much for That she tackled to American health care system and in 2003 in We Need to Talk About Kevin, it was school shootings. The story consists of Eva Khatchadourian's letters to her husband Franklin; they start from twelve months after their son Kevin has done the unthinkable and killed seven classmates, one teacher and a cafeteria worker. Eva is looking back over her and Franklin's life together. Their life is going along pretty damn well except for the issue of having children. Eva finally capitulates after she decides she wants a child for her own selfish reasons. Parenthood is not easy for Eva and this is the manner in which her whole relationship with Kevin proceeds. Although not for lack of trying on Eva's behalf: Kevin is a difficult child, he thwarts Eva at every turn and responds only to Franklin. This is the pattern of their family life on a whole. Motherhood is not a happy experience for Eva and Kevin is far from the ideal child. In my opinion, he is downright evil, conniving and socio-pathic. The method Kevin employs to kill his victims is both unexpected and shocking; indeed, reflective of his warped personality.One long barrage of missives after another, you hear nothing but Eva's side, Eva's viewpoint, Eva's feelings and while this could be stultifying, it works because it intensifies Eva's position. But on the whole, Eva's attendant reasonings for having a child in the first place are so skewed, is it any wonder the event would be so miserable an exercise for her? The term Kevin used to address his mother with, I found totally creepy: \"Mommer\", it almost sounds mechanical or robotic. I read We Need to Talk About Kevin when it was first published and upon my second read, for me the subject matter is still Fifty Shades Of Awful. It was a very disturbing read. I finished the book near midnight and the ending slewed me. Like a kid who needs a comedy after a horror movie, I had to then start re-reading one of my favourite novels to dispel the images We Need To Talk About Kevin had imprinted on my consciousness. The Daily Mail cited it as \u201charrowing, tense and thought-provoking\u201d and I agree on all counts. Shriver won the 2005 Orange Prize for Fiction for this novel and frankly, I am surprised it did not win the Pulitzer. It has sold over one million copies and if you haven't read this book, you are missing out on an incredible piece of literature. Although saying it was enjoyable in the normal sense of the word would be a stretch, none the less, it was a novel I could not put down. 5\u2605"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim", "userReview": "This book scared the living crap out of me. (living crap? Really? Is there another kind? I mean, is it dead when it\u2019s out of you? I\u2019m sorry\u2026 not getting it)I kind of sort of knew the gist of the book. It was a rubbernecker\u2026 something to do with a deviant child, national tragedy, bandwagon message but I was not expecting this. It is so well written, so proper in its delivery that it takes awhile to warm up to the protagonist as she writes these letters to her husband post trauma or as she calls it. Thursday. The mother (Eva) of said deviant (Kevin) is a successful entrepreneur, having written bohemian style travel guides for a few decades. She has this Eastern European nature\u2026 her delivery, her stance, her last name (Khatchadourian) all lead you to believe that she is above the common American. For example \u201cI have even declined, once or twice, those few invitations out that still jangle my phone, usually friends from abroad who e-mail from time to time, but whom I haven\u2019t seen for years. Especially if they don\u2019t know, and I can always tell; innocents sound too roisterous, whereas initiates begin with a deferential stutter and a hushed, church tone.\u201d See? She has this aloofness that is both comforting and staggering. And way too familiar. Let\u2019s get back to why this book scares me. Her son is freaking evil. Yes, Damien evil. She takes time within the letters to detail Kevin\u2019s life and her feelings regarding motherhood\u2014maybe they are justifications of her lack of feelings. Anywho\u2026 Kevin is a monster. Truly. If I had this kid\u2026. Christ\u2026. Thank god, I don\u2019t have this kid. From birth, when he refuses to take his mother\u2019s milk (granted, not unusual) to toddler-hood, where he screams non-stop for HOURS with no reason, to preschooler, where he refuses to talk until he\u2019s three and then the first thing out of his mouth is \u2018I don like that\u2019 to kindergarten, where he refuses to potty train until he\u2019s six (just because) to prepubescent, where he is babysitting his younger sister and there is an \u2018accident\u2019 involving drain cleaner and losing an eye to adolescence, where, on Thursday, he invites ten people to the school gym, locks them in and takes the next hour or so to pick them off with his crossbow. EVIL. There it is. Rubbernecking\u2026 what would you do? She feels responsible for having a pseudo relationship with him\u2026 going through the motherly motions\u2026 yet; she can\u2019t take responsible for nature, can she? Is this a nurture issue? I can\u2019t tell\u2026 she seems to do everything she\u2019s supposed to do. Her husband is the ever all-too-doting-if-you-ask-me father figure. There is never TANGIBLE proof that this is happening\u2026 what the hell do you do? Here are excerpts from a conversation between Eva and Kevin in the juvenile detention center\u2026 a year and a half after Thursday:Kevin: 'You never wanted to have me, did you?'Eva: 'I thought I did.' I said. 'And your father, he wanted you desperately.'Kevin: 'You thought you did.' He said. 'You changed your mind.'Eva: 'I thought I needed a change.' I said. 'But no one needs a change for the worse. Motherhood was harder than I\u2019d expected. I explained. I was used to airports, sea views, museums. Suddenly I was stuck in the same few rooms, with Lego.'Kevin: 'But, I went out of my way' he said with a smile that lifted lifelessly as if by hooks, 'to keep you entertained.'Eva: 'I\u2019d anticipated mopping up vomit. Baking Christmas cookies. I couldn\u2019t have expected---'Kevin\u2019s look dared me. 'I couldn\u2019t have expected that simply forming an attachment to you, 'I phrased as diplomatically as I knew how, '\u2018would be so much work, I thought---' I took my breath. 'I thought that part came free.'Kevin: 'Free!' he jeered. 'Waking up every morning isn\u2019t free.'Eva: 'Not any more.' I conceded dolefully.*Kevin\u2019s and my experience of day-to-day life has converged. Time hangs off me like molting skin.*I believe that Eva did try her best. New moms have no idea what they are getting into\u2026 some have more of an instinct than others\u2026 some are pragmatic\u2026. Some are neglectful. Eva did her best with what she knew\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could have done any better. My kids are past the age where I question that they are sociopaths\u2014I know that\u2019s a loaded statement---but, I truly believe it. Kevin gave nothing. He reveled in the absence of life. Of not expecting anything, not wanting anything, not betraying this \u2018not\u2019 behavior. I\u2019m sure it was hard work. I\u2019m sure the snarky way he treated his father eventually took a toll, his dad was too dumb to see the show. \u201cThe truth is, the vanity of protective parents that I cited to the court goes beyond look-at-us-we\u2019re-such-responsible-guardians. Our prohibitions also bulwark our self-importance. They fortify the construct that we adults are all initiates. By conceit, we have earned access to an unwritten Talmud whose soul-shattering content we are sworn to conceal from \u201cinnocents\u201d for their own good. Presumably we have looked the horror in the face, like staring into the naked sun, blistering into turbulent, corrupted creatures, enigmas even to ourselves. Gross with revelation, we would turn back the clock if we couldn't, but there is no unknowing of this awful canon, no return to the blissfully insipid world of childhood, no choice but to shoulder this weighty black sagacity, whose finest purpose is to shelter our air-headed midgets from a glimpse of the abyss. The sacrifice is flatteringly tragic. The last thing we want to admit is that the forbidden fruit on which we have been gnawing since reaching the magic age of twenty-one is the same mealy Golden Delicious that we stuff into our children\u2019s lunch boxes. The last thing we want to admit is that the bickering of the playground perfectly presages the machinations of the boardroom, that our social hierarchies are merely an extension of who got picked first for the kickball team, and that grown-ups still get divided into bullies and fatties and crybabies. What\u2019s a kid to find out? Presumably we lord over them an exclusive deed to sex, but this pretense flies so fantastically in the face o fact that it must result from some conspiratorial group amnesia. To this day, some of my most intense sexual memories date back to before I was ten.In truth, we are bigger, greedier versions of the same eating, shitting, rutting ruck, hell-bent on disguising from somebody, if only from a three-year-old, that pretty much all we do is eat and shit and rut.  THE SECRET IS THERE IS NO SECRET. That is what we really wish to keep from our kids, and its suppression is the true collusion of adulthood, the pact we make, the Talmud we protect.\u201dWhoo! That was a helluva lot of quote, but please read it. It sums it up\u2026 the whole circle of life that moves us all.

HOW DO I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH?The details: A few weeks ago, a GR friend of mine reviewed a book about women who are regretlessly childless. (Yes, my spellchecker just told me \"regretlessly\" isn't a word. It is now.) A troll swaggered over to the comment section and mansplained that he knows plenty of women who wish they'd had kids when they had the chance, so all us gals should go home and reproduce now if we haven't already.I thought of him when I read We Need To Talk About Kevin. Which, just for the record, was written by a woman who really, really doesn't regret not having kids, and who wrote this brilliant story about a woman who didn't want kids but had them anyway.Shriver captured so many of my own feelings that I reached a point where I had to put this book down every few pages, saunter into my 17-year-old son's room, and say, \"Um, you're okay, right? Feeling pretty good today? No urges to, I don't know, mow down a bunch of your classmates?\"And he'd say, \"Mom, I don't have classmates, remember? We homeschool.\"And I'd say, \"JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.\"Okay, that didn't happen. But this book definitely spooked me. Partly because it's terrifying, and partly because although I had a child because I wanted to and I see no reason to think he's a sociopath (and lots of evidence to support the idea that he empathizes with those around him to a painful extent), I shared a lot of this narrator's emotional experiences.I, too, gave birth and waited for that \"I would do ANYTHING for this person\" wave of unconditional love to hit me the way everyone promised it would. And you know what? It didn't. Not when the midwife handed me my newborn and all I felt was terrified that this child who felt less like a baby and more like an uncooked chicken would slip from my arms and I'd set a land-speed record for Worst Mother Ever. Not in the next few weeks, when I was numb with exhaustion and what I now know was a pretty dire case of postpartum depression and all I could think was, I'm supposed to be the happiest I've ever been. What's wrong with me? Not in the months that followed, when I felt a sort of guilty anger over feeling trapped with someone who certainly needed me, but didn't seem to love or even like me.I remember almost bursting into tears when I read an op-ed piece in a local parenting newsletter. The author's youngest child was a few months old, and had just reached, according to the writer, \"that adorable age\" when a baby's face lights up when her mother comes into the room and picks her up from her crib after naptime. I remember thinking, You have to be fucking kidding me. Because my son was the same age as her child, and if I ever pulled a stunt like leaving him alone long enough for him to notice I was gone, he wouldn't have beamed at me when I came back. He would \u2013 and I knew this from bitter experience \u2013 have given me a look that said, \"Where the hell have you been?\"And naptime? What was that? He slept so little that my friends tried to cheer me up by sending me articles about how kids who don't nap grow up to be total geniuses. I remember looking at him one particularly rough day and thinking, You'd better grow up to be Mozart, pal. And by the way \u2013 it still won't make up for putting me through this.I'd been a nanny for years. I'd taken care of two younger siblings when I was a teen and they were caboose babies no one else had time for. Heck, I'd even taken a live-in job in a home for severely disabled children.Nothing had prepared me for this, because my kid just plain wasn't like other kids. And I wasn't the kind of easygoing person who would be a good match for him. I don't roll with the punches. I punch back.We weren't a good fit, and nobody had ever said that was a possibility. You had a kid and you loved your kid and it was a hard job but the loving made it all worthwhile.So my guilt increased, which of course did wonders for my still-undiagnosed depression.I remember saying in desperation to my stepmother, \"I just want to be able to put him down once in a while.\" She laughed heartlessly and said, \"He's a baby! What did you expect?\"Later that same visit, he fell asleep. I put him in his crib. Twenty minutes later, he woke up howling. I went and got him. My stepmother looked at me. \"That's it?\" she asked. \"That's the whole nap?\"\"That's it,\" I said grimly. \"That's a good day, for him.\"She looked humbled. \"I remember when Brian was a baby. I really counted on those couple of hours when he went to sleep and I could get something done after lunch.\"\"Must have been nice,\" I said.I felt guilty at feeling so \"touched out\" all the time, and I felt really guilty when I thought about a friend of mine who had dealt with depression of her own and who swore that after she had her baby, she never felt suicidal again, or even all that depressed, because it just wasn't an option anymore. \"Life stops being about you and starts being about them,\" she said. Unless you're me, apparently. I love my son. I did even then. I'd die for him, and I took and continue to take great pleasure in his company. I think the world is a better place for having him in it.I loved him, even when I worried that I didn't. But it wasn't frothy or overwhelming or all-at-once, and it didn't turn me into one of those baby-talking morons I still dislike. And I'm not at all convinced that even now, when things are much easier and we can both consciously work on our relationship and I love and like my kid \u2013 even now I'm not convinced my love is completely unconditional.Maybe it is. Or maybe I'm just not cut out for that kind of emotional work. So it's a good thing my son is really really almost certainly not a Kevin. Getting back to the actual book I'm supposed to be talking about here: This is the story of a terrible mother who didn't love her baby, so he grew up to be a monster. Or maybe it's the story of a flawed but not evil woman who happened to give birth to a Bad Seed. Or maybe life is way too complicated to be forced into such oversimplifications.All I know is that this book is scary as hell \u2013 and yet I found it oddly reassuring to read about a woman whose clueless husband asks what she'd expected motherhood to be \u2013 \"a walk in the park?\"\"Not a carefree stroll,\" she snaps back, \"but this is like being mugged in the park!\"And then, a few pages later, that narrator admits to a friend that someone forgot to hit her with the magic motherlove wand:\"I realize this doesn't sound very nice. But I keep waiting for the emotional payoff.\"I loved the dark humor in passages like this one:\"I realize it's commonplace for parents to say to their child sternly, 'I love you, but I don't always like you.' But what kind of love is that? It seems to me that comes down to, 'I'm not oblivious to you \u2013 that is, you can still hurt my feelings \u2013 but I can't stand having you around.' Who wants to be loved like that? Given a choice, I might skip the deep blood tie and settle for being liked.\"And I almost burst into tears \u2013 in a good way, kind of \u2013 from the relief of seeing someone else say this:Let's talk about power. In the domestic policy, myth dictates that parents are endowed with a disproportionate amount of it. I'm not so sure. Children? They can break our hearts, for a start. They can shame us, they can bankrupt us, and I can personally attest that they can make us wish we were never born. What can we do? Keep them from going to the movies.If you're going to read this book \u2013 and I think you should \u2013 don't read anything about it. (This review doesn't count. It's mostly about me, anyway.) I was innocently reading an article in the New Yorker about Lionel Shriver, and the idiot writer spelled out the whole surprise ending without any warning at all. If Christine Smallwood is reading this: all is NOT forgiven. Why would you even do that? Either I've read the book, in which case I already know the ending and don't need you to tell me; or I HAVEN'T YET, in which case you should burn in a very specific hell in which you and your fellow sufferers are clonked on the head by a constant rain of hardcover copies of brilliant novels, and when you finally manage to find shelter and pick one up and start reading it, you get halfway through and then Satan strolls up and spoils the ending for you and YOU HAVE TO KEEP READING ANYWAY.Not that I'm bitter or anything.Read this book and be prepared to have the pants scared off you. Oh, and if you're happily childless?

Eva never really wanted to be a mother and certainly not the mother of the unlovable boy who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and a much-adored teacher who tried to befriend him, all two days before his sixteenth birthday. Now, two years later, it is time for her to come to terms with marriage, career, family, parenthood, and Kevin's horrific rampage in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her estranged husband, Franklin. Uneasy with the sacrifices and social demotion of motherhood from the start, Eva fears that her alarming dislike for her own son may be responsible for driving him so nihilistically off the rails.", "title": "We Need to Talk About Kevin", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/817792.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440645280l/817792.jpg", "reviews": 11990, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45922.Lionel_Shriver", "name": "Lionel Shriver"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/817792.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8192075-we-need-to-talk-about-kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11717915-we-need-to-talk-about-kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/870775.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12832697-dobbiamo-parlare-di-kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12950506-we-need-to-talk-about-kevin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25119171", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/393060.The_Post_Birthday_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16128105-big-brother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6839917-so-much-for-that", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27064345-the-mandibles", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288629.Double_Fault"]}
