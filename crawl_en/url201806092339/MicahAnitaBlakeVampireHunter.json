The first 6 books in this series are great. From then on they seem to turn more and more into porn, starting soft and steadily progressing into hardcore, whereas they used to be a really great exploration of what a world where the paranormal mixes with the normal would be like.So, basically, I stopped buying them but will still pick them up from the library, or if I see them at a garage sale for cheap.That said, Micah, which is 3 books ago in the series and I hadn't read, well, I'm up to page 100 and Anita still hasn't 'f*cked someone's brains out', as Laurell so quaintly describes Anita's sexual escapades now. Maybe there's hope for Laurell yet?----Adding to what I wrote above, while still reading the book, I have to say now that I've finished it that Laurell may have been convinced by her editors, publishers or even feedback from fans to lay off of the unnecessary and gratuitous sex scenes. Micah would have been better off as a short story (really not enough material to justify book length on this one), but I was glad to see Laurell showing a hell of a lot more restraint when it comes to sex, than in her prior books in this series."}, {"userName": "Tilly Slaton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6289182-tilly-slaton", "userReview": "Micah is a very interesting character. As I\u2019ve already mentioned he is one of my favorite sweeties. Micah and Nathaniel completely rock my world!Micah was one of my refuges. His arms, his body, his smile. His quiet acceptance of me, violence and all. Now I was back to being scared. Shit.With that said, this book must have been rushed. Either it was rushed or it took awhile to write because it was\u2026boring. I really dislike writing negative reviews, but this is one of my least favorite books in this series. Total bummer.When you're reading a series and one of the main characters, one of whom you adore, takes the spotlight in a book all his own ... you want a great backstory! You want a fantastic book that gives you a hello there baby feeling about a character who consumes you. That is not what happens with this book.I adore Olaf and Nathaniel. I sincerely hope that if they receive the attention that is well deserved, it is given with brilliance and passion. I just won't take kindly if Nathaniel is explained in 200 pages ;)The \"ardeur\" completely changed the direction of this series. Once, Blake was a strong-minded, arrogant and a complete prude.Through ties to Jean-Claude I\u2019d inherited some abilities. One of those abilities was the ardeur. It was as if sex were food, and if I didn\u2019t eat enough I got sick.This book takes you out-of-town. Blake needs to raise a zombie for the courts and in order to survive the ardeur, she must bring a sweetie with her or ravage some unworthy stranger.Micah accompanies her, and although there are mild disagreements between them, it\u2019s more or less a yawn grasping story.I really should give this review my full attention and try to point out some interesting aspects but unfortunately, there are none.Zombie. Sex. Death. Survival. That about sums it up.The truth may not set you free, but used carefully, it can confuse the hell out of your enemies.I recommend this book to those reading this series. It can actually be skipped over and not mess with the storyline. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll suffer through the book because skipping is cheating. Not to mention the OCD would just go all wacky ..Mild sexual content, mild violence. I recommend this book to mature adults.Happy Reading!"}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "In this little short story we get to see once again that Micah is way too good for Anita. He is such a nice guy, but way too easy to steamroll. And, Anita is the definition of a steamroller. A bitchy steamroller. run away, Micah!So, Micah travels out of town with Anita to do a zombie-raising, and they get to spend time alone for the first time. Of course this makes Anita nervous and bitchy. He even changes their motel room for a nice hotel, on his dime, and she acts like he just cut the bitch. For some reason, him doing this romantic gesture makes her angry. Unreasonably angry. Seriously? Micah, I know a lot of women who would show some appreciation for you and your..um.. gifts.Also, there is a scene where Micah talks about his brother, and Anita says that she didn't even know he had siblings. Really? He's been living with her for months, sleeping together, and they haven't even talked about the things I know about my grocery store deli clerk? (Hey, people are friendly in the South. If you go to the grocery store, you leave with milk, bread, and a few new friends.)So, basically, this was just another book highlighting the selfish bitchiness of our main character.

His pregnant wife, Tammy, is going into premature labor, and he can't fly out to Philadelphia to raise a zombie for a case. Anita agrees to go, and to restrain the pesky ardeur, she brings along Micah.If I had spent money on this audiobook, I'd be asking for a refund right about now. Unabridged, this \"novel\" is a mere 4 hours long. Ellen Degeneres' Seriously...I'm Kidding is the same length, and I think I may have liked that one better.Anyway, after the atrocity that was Incubus Dreams, a largely plotless book that spent more time with Anita hopping in an out of guys' pants than any crime, I wasn't sure I'd ever return to this series. But I needed something a bit lighter than I had been reading, and I figured that the teenie-tiny \"Micah\" couldn't be as bad as \"Dreams\".Turns out, I was right! I found this book to be a great improvement over \"Dreams\". Gone are the five hour long arguments over who is going to sleep with Anita when and in what position. Gone are the constant fights with authority figures. Gone are the endless meanderings of Anita about her relationships. Gone are Anita's hatred for women. This book focuses intensely on Anita and Micah and their relationship. And in that regard, this book is a winner. We actually have time to look at the two and feel their chemistry. And as long as you forget the rape-y shower scene in Narcissus in Chains, you might find yourself liking Micah quite a bit more.But just because this book is better than \"Dreams\", doesn't mean it's fabulous and I'm an Anita Blake fan. I mean, dirt is better than kitty poo, after all. This book has plenty of flaws along with our favorite LKHisms:1. I found myself being OK with Micah - right up until this exchange:\"What was the first straw?\"He looked down, and I realized he was embarrassed. \"What?\" I asked.\"I was too big.\"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! How am I supposed to listen to that with a straight face? How did the NARRATOR read that with a straight face?2. How big is too big?Long enough that he could touch his own belly button without using his hands. Thick enough that I couldn't get finger and thumb completely around him when he was at his thickest.Wow, how does Micah have sex with anyone with a schlong like that? I'd think he'd send women to the HOSPITAL with a Wang like that!3. Just in case you thought Anita might actually start acting and talking like a feminist - no worries! She's the same sexist, misogynistic a-hole as ever! When Larry calls needing help, Anita volunteers, no questions-asked, no hard feelings. But last book, when Ronnie called up drunk, despairing over a broken relationship, Anita got upset that Ronnie made her go to a club to save her and \"threaten\" her delicate Wangs.\"I probably overshared. That girlness again.\" -> Yucky girlness! It's not like GUYS ever overshare or that women DON'T.\"It felt weak and very girl-ic and I didn't like it.\" -> Because doing anything remotely associate with being a woman is BAD. And \"girly\" is now too bleh of a word to use, so let's invent a new one!\"How many women had hurt him?\" -> What about all the women he caused to bleed when he jammed his Wang into them? No, we can't possibly have compassion to them! They are just horrible because they are born with Woohoos that aren't big enough for His Bigness.4. The ardeur (pronounced humorously as \"ar DOOR\") is back! Fortunately, it only appears once. Unfortunately, the sex scene is your typical squickiness we've come to know and love from LKH, filled with endless repetitions of \"F- me!\", \"So wet, so tight\", and \"OMG, is it even going to fit?!\"5. Fox and later Franklin both take offense at Anita, as cops in this world are wont to do whenever she appears. Because women in the law enforcement fields in the naughties is so uncommon. Fox quickly though comes to the Light Side when Anita tells him that no, she didn't flirt with a guy from Obsidian Butterfly and everything is totes OK. The other guy makes an excellent point, which Anita steamrolls over. Because while others can't twist the laws to their wills, Anita better'd be able to, gorrammit!What is it about her? She blinks those big brown eyes and everyone just looks the other way as she breaks a dozen rules am bends the very law we're sworn to uphold?6. The last 20 min of a 4 hour audiobook wrap up the book. More time is spent with Micah and Anita talking or having sex than the so-called plot.What is sadly absent are endless pages of clothing descriptions and truly execrable writing. LKH does detail what Micah and Anita wear, but for once, it was rather brief and not that flowery. As for the writing quality, it wasn't half bad - much like the beginning books - with the exception of the items from #4.This is definitely not the worst of the series; yes, it's not great, but at points, it wasn't half bad. And having it so short was a plus - at least we didn't have 80 repetitive sex scenes and police p!ssing contests! However, I would definitely not recommend buying this; spending full price for this extremely short book is a waste of trees and paper. Pick up a copy used (shouldn't be a problem finding one) or at the library."}, {"userName": "Denisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14215152-denisa", "userReview": "This book had no ending. Hell, it didn't even have a beginning. I thought I'll really like this one, expected to like it more than the others. But I guess people are right, the series is really going downhill. This story was short and pretty boring, I got used to more exciting stories."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922560-andrea", "userReview": "If I had to pinpoint the exact moment my heart broke while reading this book, it would have to be when Micah earnestly explains to Anita how he'd been unsuccessful in prior relationships due to the enormous size of his wang. Some women, Anita recognizes astutely, are just not built for such endowments. Luckily, Anita is there for him, to love him in all the ways his previous girlfriend couldn't, and to help him begin the healing process.To be fair, I read this book after I had already \"broken up\" with LKH over Incubus Dreams, but it was in the dollar bin at the used book store, and I got all nostalgia-faced about Anita Blake and couldn't resist picking up. I really should have resisted.Between the larger text, the line-spacing, and the wider margins, this book is much shorter than it appears, but honestily that's a blessing because I never would have made it through another hundred pages of this crap. On top of being short on text, the text was light on actual content. There was a lot of awkward exposition from Anita about her unconventional sex life and commitment issues, and a long, boring, and poorly-edited sex scene. I'd never really cared about Micah in the previous books (like, why was he there? didn't Anita already have enough on her plate?) and this one, in which he's the title freaking character did absolutely nothing to change my mind. LKH, this was a momentary error in judgment. It meant nothing, really. I'm sorry, we're still totally broken up."}, {"userName": "Merredith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1583037-merredith", "userReview": "Micah by Laurell K hamilon, was a fake book. Here we have the 245 page new installment in the Antia Blake series, but it's just a filler\u2026 Remember when you were in school, and your teacher assigned you a certain number of page paper to do? But you really didn't have too much to write\u2026 So you space it out as far as you can\u2026. That's what Hamilton did for this book. Her books are usually tiny print, words packed into the pages, and STILL long. This has the largest ever typeface, sooo spaced out, borders around each page, a whole blank page for each new chapter\u2026 She used every trick in the book to fill up her quota. The whole book is as big as one or two chapters in a normal book, and has as much information. We learn how Micah became a wereleopard, and that's it.

This is normally where I insert my complaints about how I don\u2019t like novellas, but I\u2019ll pass on it this once.But I will say if you are going to write a novella, you have little space to actually waste words \u2013 your words have to count. You can\u2019t write an 80 page story and then waffle. Unfortunately, this book does waffle \u2013 partly with the standard over-descriptive style interspaced with an annoying amount of recapping (though, to be fair, both are far more restrained than is common in the series) and partly with it taking its time to get on with the plot.We then have scenes that take too long, add very little and take up space: a sex scene to be exact. And there was the obligatory Agent who calls in Anita but can\u2019t be professional enough to hide his obvious dislike (all these people who hate Anita, none of them capable of a veneer of civility) which means we have to have a longwinded rendition of Anita vs The Haterz that will only get worse from this point in the series.We also have a lot of revisiting of Anita\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m not actually against exploring Anita\u2019s need to constantly sabotage her own relationships, being awkward for awkwardness sake and often fleeing into anger whenever she feels any kind of emotion because she\u2019s terrified of anything that may make her slightly vulnerable. These would be interesting things to explore \u2013 but less so things to repeat ad nauseum. Exploration is not the same as repetition especially in a novella where we have limited space to actually develop things.One thing I was eager to see was some development of Micah. By this phase in the books Micah is pretty much a short guy who is a wereleopard and has a really big penis. As one of Anita\u2019s main men \u2013 growing ever more important \u2013 it would be nice for him to be more than the Giant Kitty Cock (there\u2019s a mental image for you).Of course, this being the Anita Blake Series, \u201cdevelopment\u201d means \u201cbig load of angst.\u201d So we get Micah angst\u2026 about being a wereleopard (therefore a monster) and having a huge cock (and how this made dating hard).Y\u2019know it could be an interesting thing to examine that the much vaunted mega-penis of doom actually has a downside, that most women don\u2019t actually want anything to do with a penis the size of their arm and that it\u2019s very easy to be fetishized because of it. Except we had it used as another example of how Anita is better than all women because not only can she take the super ginormocock of doom but she can do it with minimal foreplay while so very very very very tight (as we were told at extreme length) because she is ANITA!Read More"}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8240729-liz", "userReview": "I was so pissed off when I got home and opened the book. I already knew it only a hundred pages or so but it was also double spaced! I paid like 5 bucks for something that had less content then a newspaper. The story was the usual \"I'm Anita Blake. I dress like a slut because my seven boyfriends like it. Not because I am one. Well, actually, I am but it's not my fault. I have this condition called the aurdor which means I have to hump every hot guy I come across. If your not sexy enough for me then I will probably shoot you because I am so fucking bad ass and because you obviously hate women.\" God. I wish I could punch her in the face. That feminazi stuff gets on my last nerve. A little is okay but if she isn't screwing someone she is cussing them out. LKH's books are just like scooby doo with TONS of sex. It's always the ominous person you meet in the beginning of the book. There. I just just saved you all a lot of time and money. The first few are pretty good until Anita turns in into a psycho slut. Then it's all downhill from there. Although if you are into erotica books then you might enjoy these.

First of all, what would normally be five chapters or so in any other book has been stretched out (with large margins, extra spacing between words and lines, and a full page for each chapter number) into twelve. Which means that Hamilton's annoying habit of chapter-long disgustingly graphic sex scenes turned into Hamilton's annoying habit of THREE-chapter-long disgustingly graphic sex scenes--only this time with the stupidest, most eye-roll inducing dialogue I've ever read. Seriously. And the plot is terribly simplistic. Anita gets asked by Larry to take one of his zombie-raising jobs at the last minute, and she takes Micah with her, you know, for the sex. They share their scar stories, there's some talk about how BIG Micah is (ahem), sex, sex, sex, more Micah is SO BIG, and then they go to the job which, of course, goes horribly wrong. This happens in the second-to-last chapter. In the last chapter, Anita wakes up in the hospital and is told that ho-hum, everything turned out fine. The end.

It allows Anita to spend some alone time with Micah and also gets her a bit back to the zombie raising that seems to fade into the background in many of the recent books.Anita is a lot to handle, in life, and especially in this book. Her fear of commitment comes to a head while away with Micah, forcing her to voice all her crazy \"why would anyone love me?\" thoughts. Somehow Anita becomes both needy and distant at the same time. Micah finally starts to show a bit of what he's been thinking this whole time and the insight into his character goes a long way in explaining his calm demeanor.Anita and Micah are in Philadelphia on this trip, but just about nothing of the city is shown. The thing that really made this novella worth the read was that we finally start getting some answers - more than just theories - about what's going on with Anita metaphysically.

All but one of those 5 scenes had another character either taking part in some way, or watching while laying in bed with Anita and \"fill in blank\" In this book there was only one sex scene and it was not a group activity so that was much better. I like Micah. I read a few reviews and a lot of the opinions lie with not liking him. While he isn't my type physically he has an awesome personality and I think is the perfect match to Anita. This book did not hold much action, or suspense, and I do agree with one persons description of it being more a fluff piece, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and liked getting a little bit of insight into Micah. Very short read by the way. I am a slow reader and I read it in about 4 hours total."}, {"userName": "mlady_rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732709-mlady-rebecca", "userReview": "Shorter than the rest of the series, it's hard to judge this one on the same scale. Not much happened, but then there wasn't time for much to happen. We learned a bit about Micah and saw an interesting zombie case, but there weren't any real developments above and beyond the blood test results, which were reiterated in the beginning of \"Danse Macabre\".Character wise, the only ones we really saw besides Micah and Anita were Larry (via phone) and Nathaniel at the beginning and end. The scene with Nathaniel at the end was my favorite part of the book. He's so damn cute. *g* And Micah's comment about Asher watching Nathaniel at the beginning was the new tidbit I most wanted to see explored. Hey, I just love Nathaniel. Sorry Micah fans.Then there was the comment about the roses. Still want Richard's reaction to that one. *g*(Reviewed 04/08/2009.)"}, {"userName": "Chibineko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4436152-chibineko", "userReview": "(sigh) Laurell, what's happened to you? Is putting out a book a year draining you too much? There's no excuse for this. Micah is a novella dressed up to look like a full novel. The plotline is barely there, the characterizations are shallow, and everything just seems wooden & unlikable. The book is actually just as cheaply done as anything else, as the spacing is overdone in order to stretch out a 100-ish page novel out into 300-ish pages. If this had been published as a short story I wouldn't have minded the barely there plotline or dull characters. But as a novel, let alone as an actual numbered book in the series? That's unforgivable. I can only hope that eventually things will improve. As it is, this book contributed to why I no longer purchase her books anymore and why I no longer have read anything after this book."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2543542-jason", "userReview": "OMG this was a terrible book.

Micah is probably my favorite man in a Anita's life, second only to Jean-Claude. I love the balance he brings, being so opposite of Anita, and I'm really glad that LKH wrote this book because while I've given up on the series for the most part, I was happy to read more about Micah. He kinda gets pushed aside for men that have been in Anita's life longer, and then pushed aside to make room for even more men and he's such an easy character to love. It was wonderful to read their little side adventure. Definitely a pleasant break from the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Karen Dales", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2286422-karen-dales", "userReview": "I have to admit. I did not buy this novel. It was given to me. For that I'm thankful I didn't have to shell out money for it. I was expecting more about Micah and his backstory, instead I got backstory on how big his dick was. Sorry not interested. One thing that allowed me to give it two stars instead of one, is that, for a surprising change, there is a bit of a plot to this novel and it wasn't filled with pornographic beastiality sex scenes.

Damn if I didn\u2019t want to jump into this book to play the role of Micah.I wanted so much to be Micah in the nice hotel room trip down memory lane when Anita pulled him to her chest. OOO-RAH!! Being \u201cnot small\u201d provoked a lot of dialog including the \u201cOld Double Standard\u201d reference to males only wanted sex.\n \u201cBe careful where you point that, it might go off!!\n The rest of the bedroom scene sounded delicious. Yummy!! \n \u201cBlink if you can hear me.\u201d\n Licking my lips!!! Anita seems to like well-endowed men and couldn\u2019t walk even if the fire alarm sounded.This is all about Anita\u2019s relationship with Micah, who goes with her to Philadelphia to perform a zombie animation including some weird twists. The assignment is not exactly what she was told as she was substituting for Larry Kirkland whose wife is in premature labor.Through this novella, Anita continues to struggle with her arduer effects which cause her to have sex ever few hours. As normal, Anita is able mostly to resolve each of these difficulties by the end. And of course, Anita is injured and knocked unconscious at the animation but her zombie came to the rescue along with Micah. This adult extra erotica Anita book was full of sex and intrigue and most enjoyable. I\u2019m off to get the next in the series and hope it is as HOT."}, {"userName": "Adriane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4719565-adriane", "userReview": "This book is like a palate cleansing amuse bouche, a way to reset from the others. The other books have been rife with drama and tension and worry. In fact the last book was absolutely bogged down with the amount of crap she wanted to fit into one story and just ran out of room for the mystery part. In comparison this one was a breath of fresh air. Simple zombie raising gone wonky, with some naughty Micah time on the side. My only complaint is that it was so short, literally took me a day to read which isn't unheard of but I mean, I guess I'm just being fussy cause I paid 8 bucks for it and assumed it would be as meaty as the last 2 books. I read these on Kindle so I can't tell from the look of the book how long it is, I usually determine it by how long it takes me to read or what it says on the buying page. It's totally my bad, but I'm waiting a few days to purchase the next book."}], "description": "\"RAISING THE DEAD IS EASY.
