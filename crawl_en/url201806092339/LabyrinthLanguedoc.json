It was hard to get into, but overall I liked it more than not. Mosse's writing made me cringe at times. So much unnecessary description. (Who did her editing? They should be ashamed.) And the passiveness of characters telling each other the story while the reader \"listens in\" bugged me. I would have preferred just to have the historical storyline. But I understand why the author needed to have the present day involved in her story as she wanted to write it. I loved reading about the Cathars. Any enemy of the Crusades is a friend of mine. Although, come to think of it, there wasn't a whole lot of detailed discussion about the Cathars in \"Labyrinth,\" but I have been inspired to do a little reading on my own.

I enjoyed this book. Many people felt it was a bit boring and inconsistent. It was one of the earlier books I read in the adventure genre, around the time I got hooked on the Da Vinci code book and series. Ultimately, I love this genre... when you go back and forth in time periods, cover adventures, try to connect ancient peoples to someone current, find devastating secrets, a little bit of romance... all works for me. What appealed here was the French backdrop and the labyrinth puzzles. I quickly moved on to book two and recently learned of the third book, which I purchased and plan to read in June. I liked the main character, though she was a little distant at times... Enjoyed the descriptions and scenery. It had a bit of a fantasy / ghost appeal to it, too. Felt like it had a bit of everything for me. Not top notch in the genre, but still strong to me.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Still, I gave this book a chance, as I'd been impressed with Kate Mosse's work as an interviewer on the BBC's Radio 4. I'm glad that I read it. This book focuses on the Cathars, a gnostic sect centered in the Pays d'Oc, (modern southwestern France). Several legends have been told about the Cathars, including that they practiced ancient mystical rituals and that they were the guardians of the Holy Grail. What is known is that the Cathars rivaled the established church in parts of Western Europe. In the 13th century, Catholic churchmen and French nobles led an invasion of the Pays d'Oc and a bloody suppression of the Cathars, whom they regarded as heretics.Mosse combines two stories: a historical fiction, set against the invasion of the Pays d'Oc; the other, a modern thriller set in the Languedoc region of France. In these parallel stories, bad people with suspect motives are searching for the treasures that embody the secret wisdom of the Cathars (symbolized by a labyrinth). In both stories, the protagonist is trying to figure out what these treasures can be, along with how to stop the villians, without getting killed in the process. The Labyrinth dealt with many of the same themes as The Da Vinci Code, but it was superior in so many ways. I'll mention four: 1)Mosse does a good job of maintaining a sense of suspense. I wasn't able to guess what was going to happen three chapters ahead. (I always thought the Da Vinci Code's protagonist was a bit thick.) 2)Mosse doesn't make careless, glaring factual historical errors. 3)I got the feeling that Mosse knew the locales in which she set her story. 4)She's a good writer, one who doesn't rely on cliches and cheap narrative tricks.All in all, a good read, one that has got me digging through my old Medieval history books."}, {"userName": "Shovelmonkey1", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1", "userReview": "Oh the inner turmoil. Did I enjoy Labyrinth by Kate Mosse or not? Hold on... what Kate Moss the supermodel lady has written a book?No, Kate Mosse the author, not THE Kate Moss ... come on, keep up people.My two inner voices have clashed over this story and so I've given this book a middling 3 out of 5. Here is what my chatty inner voices are bickering over:LUMPEN ADVENTURE SEEKING BOOK LOVING WEEKEND SOFA SURFER BRAINBrilliant. Archaeology ladies get into all sorts of European adventure hi-jinx with a parallel time slip story line and get caught up with sinister occult goings on which ultimately wind up being tied into their own personal family history making it a sort of GRAIL LORE: THIS TIME IT'S PERSONAL style read. More murders, maniacs, manoeuvring and mendacity than Murder on the Orient Express.ACTUAL ARCHAEOLOGY BRAINWhoa. You let someone wander around on an excavation randomly digging holes wherever they like? That is NOT how it is done. Now they've found something and are tramping into a cave and moving finds and relics around without photographing or drawing them first? And they're not even an archaeologist? Ok, that's it my head just E-X-P-L-O-D-E-D , really it did, there's brain all over the place. Good job my brain exploded before the introduction of the fact that the Assistant dig director is also stealing antiquities. And obviously because there is archaeology and the grail involved then they all have PhD's. Let's face it, after Dr Robert Langdon of DaVinci Code fame, only giving these ladies a Masters degree would make you feel like they were not quite clever enough to be dealing with the subject matter.I've recently come to realise that this historical duality/ time slip story telling method is a lot more common than I thought. Ackroyd, Amis, Smith and Mosse all embrace and employ this technique and if you have an author who is equal to the task of producing two well written narratives with different tones and styles then it works well. Mosse achieves this and both stories are equally well written and engaging. Archaeology brain overrides weekend sofa surfing brain on this review though because this book sailed a little too close to the chick-lit equator for me and that is an invisible line that I sail across with great caution. Wilbur Smith ( River God: A Novel of Ancient Egypt ) and Agatha Christie ( Death on the Nile ) therefore remain Crown King and Queen of archaeology fiction for me and I don't think they'll be abdicating or getting deposed any time soon."}, {"userName": "Rachel Burton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/574616-rachel-burton", "userReview": "I've read a lot of books on the Holy Grail in my time (some may say an obsessive amount, I prefer to think of myself as thorough) from Le Morte D'Arthur to The Da Vinci Code and sadly this falls into the latter category. The main difference between Kate Mosse and Dan Brown is that Kate appears to have done her research. Her story's relationship to legend and even actual historical events is a little less tenuous that Brown's, her grasp of English is infinitely better (not hard), as is her grasp of basic French geography (note to Dan Brown: Try looking at a map of Paris at the very least before writing about the City. If you turn left out of the Louvre you do not \u2026 oh I digress, you get the picture, this is not meant to be \"Rachel slating Dan Brown again\"). Like The Da Vinci Code there are times when the bad writing style (that endless use of italics to denote a character is thinking, what's that about? I am capable of working that out for myself) is so bad you want to throw the book across the floor but sadly the plot is so gripping that you have to read it until the very end.Having said all that, Labyrinth has a lot of redeeming qualities. Firstly it's a time-slip book - half of it being set during the 13th century when the Crusaders began to turn on their own. Mosse has done a lot of intricate research into this time and really conjures up the atmosphere of medieval France as well as many who have gone before her. Secondly, the characterisation is very strong and you actually feel for all the characters in one way or another. Thirdly, it's a Grail book in which women actually get heard. If what I've deduced about Grail mythology is correct women did play an important role and I think this is what Dan Brown was rather clumsily trying to say with all his very badly misinformed Mary Magdalene information. Mosse gets the message across a little better.In conclusion: overly long, overly hyped and badly edited, but conversely I did enjoy it and it's a thousand times better than anything Dan Brown could write"}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309241-taylor", "userReview": "This pulled at me and repulsed me simultaneously. As a medievalist and amateur historian, I was addicted to learning how Mosse laid out this Grail fantasy. She treats the Cathar subjects well, clearly having spent at least a few hours on Wikipedia researching the matter. My repulsion was, however, centered on the regrettably mediocre writing. Mosse relies on heavy exposition and tosses adjectives and adverbs in like my grandmother does salt. Her characters are poorly developed, largely one-dimensional folk and her story suffers from a densely-packed exposition. As Mosse reaches a climax, she relies on her modern protagonist and characters to tell about the climax's thirteenth century events instead of allowing the reader to be present and to witness them ourselves. The additional lack of explanation about why certain items (i.e. the Labyrinth, the cave, the ring, the grail, etc.) were important or how they had come to be were entirely ignored.Bah humbug."}, {"userName": "Rusty's Ghost Engine (also known as..........

In this case historical fiction in the guise of yet another (yawn) grail quest. All these medieval storytellers (Chretien de Troyes; yes I do mean you!) have a lot to answer for. This is split between early 13th century France at the time of the Cathars and France in 2005; the main protagonists being Alais in 1205 and Alice in 2005 (Of course there isn't a link of any sort; familial, psychic or anything!!!!) . The background of the 13th century is the persecution of the Cathars in Languedoc; in the 20th century it is an archealogical dig in the same area. The whole grail thing is dressed up in slightly different robes; three old Egyptian books, a ring with a labyrinth on it, a similar bit of stone, a special cave, seversl dudes who live for centuries, a small amount of blood from people of different religions: liberally mix them up and chuck them around France and there you have it. Add some splendid villains, a few manic Catholics (a la Opus Dei in Dan Brown) and you have a mystery; spice with a few romances, some infidelity, some hopeless yearning and a spot of medieval siege warfare and serve to the readers. I think any archaelogist reading this would be horrified as I'm pretty sure that digs don't function in the way this one did. The historical part is full of holes, the switching centuries can be irritating and the whole plot requires a significant suspension of disbelief.However, it is well written, better than Dan Brown and reads easily. It also had the merit of sending me to sleep on a number of occasions. This may sound like I didn't really like it, but I've read many worse books in my time (anyone remember The Late Great Planet Earth; yes I really read that in my teens!) and it rattled along at a decent pace.

Personally, I am proud of having made to the end where so many others fallen in the effort. The writing was diabolical, the plot completely over-blown and all over the place, and the characters were pitifully one-dimensional.

Personal, er, \"highlights\" for me included, the main character (Alice) wandering around some village in the middle of nowhere only to bump into a bloke she once met yunks ago in another country. They knew each other straight away. Sure, happens all the time. Well, it has been some time since I invested (badly) two weeks of my life to reading this (ten times too long) novel. But I had to leave this review simply because others may be misled by the upcoming dramatisation. If you see it, and are tempted to buy the book: save yourselves while you still can.

The title, the cover, the blurb, the size, even the genre (historical fiction) did not excite me so I delayed, procastinated, snuck other books in ahead of it. When eventually I started reading I was fascinated from the first page and found it a riveting story. There were two stories running concurrently though 800 years apart. Each had a strong female protagonist, and the stories were cleverly linked. In the earlier thread, in medieval Carcassonne, seventeen year old Alais puts her life at risk to protect and keep hidden three ancient books which are said to hold the secret of the true Grail. Meanwhile, in contemporary southern France Alice has been volunteering on an archeological dig and has uncovered a cave which has remained hidden for eight centuries. Her discovery leads to a chain of events in which treasure hunters are desperate to get their hands on the missing books of the Grail. Readers are provided with a suspenseful story as mysteries in both times are resolved and the links between our protagonists are revealed. Clearly it's not the only one of this ilk as it has been compared to the Da Vinci code and other similar titles, none of which I'd read. Being new to this line of story I was engrossed. It exposed me to unfamiliar topics which sometimes had me confused but which I found interesting. For example, my total lack of knowledge about Cathars, about Grails and religious persecution in medieval times meant everything I read was new and exciting. I noted plenty of 1 and 2 star ratings amongst reviewers and these people seemed to have a broad base to compare it against, so perhaps it's not the greatest in the genre but I was impressed.

I didn't read The Da Vinci Code, but given that it was impossible to avoid or ignore, I understand both books tackle some similar themes. The strongest aspect of \"Labyrinth\" is that the plot is well-paced and engrossing. The back-and-forth between the medieval era and the present day generally works nicely, and the transitions are smooth, or make sense in their placement and timing. Most of the characters are well-drawn, although I do think it gets quite confusing keeping track of all of them, and a few could have been dropped or at least had their plot lines great reduced (such as Noubel, the policeman). I enjoy novels set in the medieval era as a guilty pleasure, as I often find they are saddled with ridiculous, stilted language and rather heavy-handed, melodramatic plots. While parts of \"Labyrinth\" are a bit silly (such as the sex scenes, oh brother), overall the plot is actually quite moving. The persecution of the Cathars, a heretic sect in thirteenth-century France, is handled deftly and movingly. Some of the material about the Grail was a bit complicated, I thought, and unnecessarily so. This is a far from perfect book--as others have noted, this really could have been edited into a much leaner story. But the author clearly knows her material, and overall the history and religion are handled intelligently. This is an enjoyable read that you don't have to feel guilty about indulging in, as you actually come away having learned some medieval history."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "Rating Clarification: 2.5 StarsHad potential to be a thrilling, page-turning read, but the story never seemed to take off.

The quote on the back of the paperback edition from the Kirkus Review really says it all: \u201cA quickly paced adventure that wears its considerable learning lightly \u2013 and of higher literary quality than The Da Vinci Code, to which it will inevitably be compared.\u201d And yet Labyrinth goes more than a few steps further, not just adding new and original twists to the myth of the grail, but adding a new depth and level that hasn\u2019t been seen before. As for the truth behind it all, Mosse doesn\u2019t offer a note of explanation, but leaves it to the reader\u2019s imagination.Labyrinth opens with one of the two main characters, Alice, working on an archaeological site in southern France, where she finds a hidden cave and two skeletons within. She also finds a unique ring bearing an unusual symbol: a labyrinth. Notifying the authorities of the discovered site, with the skeletons it suddenly becomes a crime scene, and the archaeologists are kicked off the site. The reader is then taken back in time to the thirteenth century, where they meet the other main character, Ala\u00efs, a young girl held back by tradition and ritual in a chivalric society where the knight and the priest are strongest. For the duration of the book, the reader follows these two characters, as they live their lives in parallel.As Alice returns to her hotel, strange things start to happen, as strangers contact her about what she found in the cave, police telling her to describe exactly what she saw and confiscating her sketches. Members of the dig go mysteriously missing, as people begin to die for unknown reasons. Finding pieces of evidence, Alice weaves together the story bit by bit, and as she does she discovers that she is intrinsically linked to it all, and most importantly to Ala\u00efs. Her strange dreams of this unknown girl from the late Middle Ages are the least of her worries.Ala\u00efs finds herself caught up in the changing and challenging times when the pope launches a crusade against the Cathars, a declared heretic group who believe that while God is absolute and utmost, the work they do in their lives is by their doing and not God\u2019s. It is a time when Christians are fighting Christians overtly because of their supposed heretical ways, but subversively because the northern French want the rich southern land of the langue d\u2019Oc. Wrapped in this dense plot is the story of the Grail, which every Christian of every group seeks, and it is only when the three ancient texts with the strange hieroglyphs are brought together, that the true way to the Grail will be shown. But the story of this Grail is not the one that we all think we know, but something deeper and more ancient that is tied in with this mysterious symbol of the labyrinth, and reaches back into Ancient Egypt and the founding of civilization.While the last third of the book seems somewhat rushed, as Mosse forgoes the back and forth chapters through time, and relies on present day characters telling what they know of the past; there is an inevitable building that results in a climactic ending of not just character realization, but eye-opening shock on the reader\u2019s part, as they finally know the whole story. Like the symbol, Labyrinth is a story that begins simple and straightforward, but grows more and more complex, until the denouement when all is revealed and finally understood.

July 2005. In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth; between the skeletons, a stone ring, and a small leather bag. Eight hundred years earlier, on the eve of a brutal crusade to stamp out heresy that will rip apart southern France, Alais is given a ring and a mysterious book for safekeeping by her father as he leaves to fight the crusaders. The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail.

I feel like she only set it in France because she is enamored with the language, which she uses way too often. To justify this, Mosse stuck in a lot of explanation for \"Why France?\" that didn't make all that much sense. All the surprises the author had in store were painfully obvious, and she used cliches to describe everything. All the women had beautiful legs (shapely, tan, thin, milky, whatever- they were gorgeous). Almost all of the characters were static, unless you count Sajhe,because supposedly he grew up, and I don't. Alice was irritating. She was so idiotic- I wanted to slap her. Alais couldn't think for herself. The Grail part wasn't even interesting- Mosse kept writing about the Truth- what Truth?

Also, where is that author, because she needs a good shaking."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/740688-kristen", "userReview": "The inside cover stuff instantly intrigued me. I'm all about mysterious/secret, lesser-known histories. And the story of the Grail is one of the most well-known of the lesser-known histories. Or even myths. While this one doesn't go into my favorite theory, it's such a page turner.You learn of both Alice and Alais in alternating chapters, and I really have to give the author credit, for both the creativity and the amount of research that went into this book. The language, the history. Truly amazing. I'd like to own this. Even though it won't have that same suspense in a second reading, I think I'll pick up on smaller nuances. And ya know what? There's real history in there, too. The Crusades, obviously. Some history of the Cathars, history of France, real people that existed. Seriously.

I was intrigued by the idea of an historical fiction book geared towards adults. But after reading the first two chapters I threw it away. I am not certain why as I don't remember any specific details. I do remember that I thought it was better written than many New York Times best sellers but that it wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Zaki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3040523-zaki", "userReview": "Labyrinth kept me reading in bed under a nice comfortable duvet for many nights.

OH, this book. Would i recommend this book? No. No I would not. Oh, dear lord, it was dire. I found so many problems with this book but I've forgotten some of them because of how long this book goes on for. That's one of the problems, by the way. The author tells, she recounts, to a degree that you don't always need. At the same time, she also skipped some things that could have done with a fuller explanation.The french everywhere was a bit jarring. I know Parfait as a food. Didn't know it was a type of Monk. It's nice that there's an exposition of the backstory of the cathars, for us people who don't actually know their religious history all that well, but it's near the end of the book. If you're like me and stubborn, you'll no doubt go along before that point hoping that you'll understand what it all means by context alone. Well, good luck with that one. I ended up giving up and googling it, so that I could understand the book better. By the time it came up in the book, I was already informed by Google and Wikipedia. Then we have the sex scenes. Were they necessary? I mean, were they really necessary? I know i'm a ~fade to black~ kind of reader, so maybe I'm just being biased, but considering there's other parts of the story were the author just skimmed over a summary instead of delving once again into the nth detail, I really don't see why they were needed when a sum up of an extra marital affair would have done the same job.And then, Then, we have the weird ~lets throw that in there~ romance. Will, a randomer Alice had met once before, years before, meets her again, they might have been in each others company for four hours, and he's pining after her and stroking her face and kissing her and Interrupting her when she's actually asking a very important valid question? He spent more time unconscious than he had in her company! And last but not least is the ending. I don't know if a book can jump the shark, but just after what I'll spoiler-freeingly call The Mirror Scene, a dying character spends what is the reading time equivalent of fifteen minutes explaining his life story. So many words, so much purple prose, and so much time to get out of there and seek medical attention. But nope.Just. Nope.And that's the crux of this review, really. \"Nope\"."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1265952-tiffany", "userReview": "Like some of the other reviews, there were times I liked the story and there were other times where I was just down right bored. The story line drew me in - two different lives were connected by history yet born centuries apart. Yet, there were several loose ends. Why did the father hate Guilhem du Mas? And if he disliked him so much, why would he allow his daughter marry him? Then in the future, I suppose when all was forgiven, why did Mosse not include the story line of Alais' rescue and the time they had a child together and then jump 30 years later to an older Alais? After this part, I just had no interest to finish the book. But, considering I already made it 500 pages, I thought I might as well finish it. What is Marie-Cecile's connection to the characters in the 13th century period? Is she the reincarnation of Oriane? Is Will also the reincarnation of Guilhem? Why were so many of the main characters not given enough of a background? Why is the history of the cave and the elements of the ritual itself not discussed? More detail please!!!I guess my main issue is that there were so many characters, not enough story line, and then loose ends. I am giving the book 2 stars because the story itself was intriguing and at times had me sitting on edge. But, it just felt like there was an entire section of the book that Mosse wrote but then chose not to include. It read like a bad movie adaptation."}, {"userName": "Maribel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/598407-maribel", "userReview": "Although I was a little dissapointed by some stinted writing and bad editing, Labyrinth still had me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what is going on. The characters tend to be two dimensional but they draw you in nonetheless. Ms. Mosse sometimes went too far with certain details (Noubel's profusive sweating - what is that about? too much info fer sure, and the sex scenes seemed to have been copied & pasted from a harlequin novel) and then did not give enough detail where warranted (the Cathars and how they came to be). The book is pretty fast paced and the one big compliment I can give to Ms. Mosse is that you can see how much she has come to love the region of Languedoc and its history. The region became a central character for me and I came to love it. She captured the desperation, terror and subsequent sadness of the inhabitants of that region and time. Ms. Mosse handled the persecution of the Cathars with great care and gave me a reason to further research their history and the French Crusade of 1209."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2042021-liz", "userReview": "This book combines all of the elements that seem to have become the rage for adventure/thriller fiction within the last few years. A Templar-esque secret society, mysterious archaeological discoveries, and drawn out cookie-cutter action scenes make up one half of this novel. the other half takes us back to medieval France where events that are the precursors of the modern story take place. The historical part is far more interesting, seeing as how the modern part consists of hardly anything but the main character getting chased from point A to point B by thugs. Just once, I wish someone would write a book based on this premise, but left the thugs out of it, and took time to actually develop the plot. Despite all this, I'm sure there were a few redeeming qualities in there somewhere. I just can't think of any right now."}], "description": "In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig, stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth.

The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail.
