OHHH....MYYYY....GOSH!!!!I was right!! well, partially anyways. I can't believe it! I'm so ecstatic right now, that I'm bouncing off the walls. The last few books that I read had endings that were just kind of... Ehhh. And I was starting to get frustrated. but this book completely took care of that! Kaylee and Tod's relationship was a long (long, long,long) time coming, even though to some people, it might have seemed rushed.And to those people, I say \"You. Are. Crazy!\" I have been waiting for this to happen since the second that Tod showed up.The book still took a few twists that I wasn't expecting, and at one point, I thought that I was going to bawl my eyes out. (if you've read the book already, you'll know what I mean). But everything ended mostly okay, and now I really can't wait to see what happens next. I love love LOVE Kaylee's relationships with Emma and Alec, and TOD. They are all so protective of each other, And yes, I still love Nash, even though I think that he could use an itty-bitty attitude adjustment. Gosh, even Sabine is starting to grow on me...

Gave it my off-the menu 6 star rating on the blog.Re-read 6/1/12. On re-read would also give it 6 stars.Every time Kaylee Cavanaugh thinks things are beginning to settle down at Eastlake High, something always happens. When she suddenly has to fight against singing for a soul in the middle of her new math teacher\u2019s class, she can hardly believe it.She knew that as long as the Netherworld\u2019s base of operations sat just below the thin veil that separated the school in her world from theirs, things wouldn\u2019t be quiet forever, but she hoped they would remain normal for just a little while longer.Long enough for her to figure out if she and Nash are really meant to be, or if his past betrayals were just too much for her to forgive. And long enough for her get used to the idea that if she gave him up, he would get back together with his ex-girlfriend Sabine, who has been waiting not so patiently for it to happen.With the clock ticking down, will Kaylee once again be the savior that everyone needs her to be? Or will time run out, with each new complication slowing her down, leaving Emma, Nash, and all of Eastlake at risk.***If I Die is the most thrilling, heartrending, explosive and exhilarating book yet in the Soul Screamers series by author Rachel Vincent. The pace never lets up, and the surprises just keep on coming.Once again the story picks up shortly after the events in the previous book, My Soul to Steal, and readers are immediately pulled into the next puzzle that Kaylee needs to solve.But before readers can even begin to unravel this mystery, the author delivers a shocking blow that makes this story even more riveting. And from then on, each moment is filled with apprehension as readers come to grips with what just might be the most heartbreaking ending yet.As Kaylee tries to deal with a new threat to Eastlake high school and keep her friends and schoomates safe from harm, she must also decide whether she\u2019ll truly be able to forgive Nash or if she should let him go, for her own happiness and his.And with an even bigger threat to herself, a mara still intent on getting between her and her boyfriend, and an unexpected complication in her already over-complicated life, Kaylee must put the pieces together and make up her mind before it\u2019s too late.Author Rachel Vincent has yet again delivered a story in her highly addictive series that is unputdownable. If I Die is even more gripping, torturous and all-consuming than its predecessors. Readers will be put on an emotional roller-coaster that won\u2019t let up until long after the book has been read.With five full-length novels and two novellas already written and with two more to come, the Soul Screamers series is immensely entertaining and has managed to carve out its own unique niche in this genre.If I Die is a must read for anyone who enjoys a nail-biting story that will keep them tied up in knots from start to finish, an incredibly fast-paced mystery with twists and turns that will keep them guessing, and a love story that will break their heart over and over.(Gave this one my off the menu 6 star rating on the blog)On a personal note:If I had to come up with just a few words to describe this book they would be: Unbelievable. Unexpected. Amazing. Shocking. Mind-blowing.If I Die starts right off with a punch to the solar plexus. I\u2019m not kidding. It nearly killed me before I even got started. I did not look at the blurb on the back of the book or even really think about the meaning behind the title when I started reading it. I read this quite early \u2013 this review will have been sitting in drafts since the beginning of June \u2013 and so I read it long before the buzz on this book started heating up. So, everything in this book was a complete shocker.Even though I read it early, it had been awhile since I\u2019d read the previous book in the series, and when I picked this up for some reason I thought this would be an easy-breezy kind of read. I completely forgot how every single book in this series by the author has at least one heart-stopping moment and that with each book I can never fully catch my breath I\u2019m so completely tense from beginning to end. It is literally like the air is being squeezed out of my lungs.This is my favorite book in the entire series. I thought the first one was, because it was the first, it was new, it was different, it was exciting, but this one has that beat. It was a complete surprise. It has made following this series worth every single moment of heartbreak, anguish, torment and distress I suffered along with Kaylee.Often, in a series that has as many books as the Soul Screamers series, they tend to lose some of that appeal. The story can feel like it\u2019s dragging and has overstayed its welcome. It is totally the opposite here. Not only is the story not flat or stale, this is the most exciting installment yet.Everything I love about Rachel Vincent\u2019s writing is back in this book \u2013 the sarcasm, the humor, and that absolutely amazing way she has of building tension \u2013 but there is way more. I thought I\u2019d met every possible baddie that the author could throw at us from the Netherworld. Well, a whole new repulsive one managed to slither its way onto the pages of If I Die.And talk about steamy. Who knew wholesome Kaylee would raise some eyebrows in this book.But I am always a sucker for a love story. And boy does this book have one of those. And yes, it did make me cry. Twice.Another thing I love about this series is that the characters are not only memorable but that you actually care what happens to each one of them. Even if you don\u2019t like them, you still want to know about them. They\u2019re not just an afterthought.Somewhere early on in this series I went from being a huge fan of Nash to Team Tod. And that almost never happens. I always think the first guy is the guy for the heroine and that\u2019s pretty much it. But that Reaper is a definite charmer. And he won me over long before the novella, but that was the clincher.As I don\u2019t include spoilers (if I can help it) I can\u2019t talk about any of the many, many things that made me laugh, cry, or just hold my breath in anticipation. But there were so very many. And I can\u2019t tell you why my heart was broken and mended and broken all over again. But it was.I cannot recommend this series enough. It is one of my very favorites, and is one of a handful that makes my heart drop to the pit of my stomach at least once in each book.******************************From my original comments:Still holding off on my review, but just had to add:Everything I love about Rachel Vincent\u2019s writing is back in this book \u2013 the sarcasm, the humor, and that absolutely amazing way she has of building tension \u2013 but there is way more. I thought I\u2019d met every possible baddie that the author could throw at us from the Netherworld. Well, a whole new repulsive one managed to slither its way onto the pages of If I Die.I think this is my favorite of the series - or it's a tie with the first book.As I can't quite talk about this without spoilers at the moment, I will just say that this book was so awesome.I really couldn't read fast enough. I was dying for every single reveal throughout the book and when they came they were...Wow...Unbelievable."}, {"userName": "Avery  ", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3318903-avery", "userReview": "***May contain spoilers***It is inevitable people are going to be heartbroken by this book because Kaylee has to make some really serious and life-changing decisions to make. That being said, the heartbreak that you are bound to experience while reading this book doesn't make you dislike the book one bit, if anything, it makes you love the world that Rachel has created even more than you thought possible. It becomes evident that Rachel has grown as an author tremendously as an author while writing this series- while I only felt \"meh\" about the first two books in the series, \"My Soul to Take\" and \"My Soul to Save\", I found \"My Soul to Keep\" and \"My Soul to Steal\" to be exceptionally better than the first two and \"If I Die\"? Well, all I can say is that Rachel really outdid herself and I am truly left speechless. I found that Kaylee really started to come into herself in \"My Soul to Steal\" (becoming a strong, independent female who wasn't afraid to stick to her guns) and she became even more so in this book, which made me like her all the more. Furthermore, while I really liked Tod in the earlier books I found myself falling even harder for him in this book. Where he was geeky and cute in the earlier books he was totally hot and swoon-worthy in this book (seriously, the whole random swirly eye thing, the over-protectiveness, and the rumbly/ lower octave voice thing going on, I don't know how a girl couldn't fall for him)! Also, I found myself really liking Sabine in this book (well, the first half more so than the second half), her life situation is pretty cruddy (being born a mara- aka a living nightmare) and therefore you cannot help but feel for her and overlook the fact that she is a conniving booger. As for Nash? Well, it should come as no surprise (based upon my reviews of the earlier books), but I have never been a fan of him and therefore (as horrible as this may sound) I wasn't at all saddened by his outcome in this book- dare I say it? I was quite happy with his outcome..."}, {"userName": "Nana Nana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4783349-nana-nana", "userReview": "If Kaylee doesn't end up with Tod in the Soul Screamers series, I'd take off Rachel Vincent in my list of favorite authors..LOL (but so far, I still love her!)...I just love Kaylee and Tod, I don't like Nash for her and rather let Sabine have him.***This book totally took me by surprise!I was only hoping for more of Kaylee/Tod flirting but never imagined that they'll end up together in this book.

Everything we thought we knew, everything we\u2019d been hoping for, planning for, and partially dreading, changes. This is a series that has been building momentum with each book, breaking rules, breaking hearts (both the readers and the characters), and IF I DIE breaks more than all the previous books combined.I\u2019ve learned from the previous books in this series that the best way to start reading this book was to take all my expectations and chuck them out. The first chapter in IF I DIE is amazing and shocking. There isn\u2019t a single thing I didn\u2019t love about it from Vincent\u2019s delicate but strong handling of a very sensitive issue to dropping the biggest bomb of the series only twenty pages in. I can never predict what Rachel Vincent will do to her characters except that regardless of how unbelievable or even cruel it may seem on the outset, she\u2019ll write it in such a way that it feels inevitable by books end. IF I DIE is the best example of that to date. Rachel Vincent writes incredibly strong and fully fleshed out characters. I never feel neutral about them. I either love them with a blazing passion, or despise them with a white hot anger. Better still are the characters who trick me into liking them before I can think to defend myself (no, not Sabine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even warm up to her). In IF I DIE, the opposite happens. One of the characters I loved from book one slips into the despise camp so slowly that I still can\u2019t believe it happened. Overall, take my advice and ditch your expectations. IF I DIE is nothing like what you think. Some characters shift into darkness and others emerge in delightful new ways. Pain, anguish, danger, desire, and selflessness are all par for the course in the Soul Screamers series, but never in ways I can predict and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to these books. If I die before BEFORE I WAKE is published in 2012, Kaylee and I will both be screaming.Sexual Content:Kissing. Scenes of sensuality.

I couldn\u2019t believe my luck at finding such a gem! Since then, it\u2019s only gotten better and better. Ms. Vincent writes the series tackling different issues in each novel-I LOVE that! There are the same characters in each novel but there\u2019s always the introduction of new characters in each one, broadening the cast and keeping the series fresh and new.In My Soul to Steal the book before If I Die, I thought my heart would break along with experiencing every other emotion out there but in If I Die, my heart truly did break. To review this book by doing a summary of events would be to completely spoil it for others. AND I refuse to bore anyone with a summary of the book, which is done well enough in the books synopsis but I will say: When you first start it, you can\u2019t possibly foresee the events unfolding as they do; as I was reading it I was surprised by how wrong I was on so many things that I was absolutely SURE were going to happen! There are plot twists, nail-biting edge of your seat suspense and thrills along with this dreadful feeling that this could possibly be the last book. This Faery would bet her best Faery Fruit wine that The Soul Screamer series is going to continue to exceed my expectations. There is absolutely nothing that I didn\u2019t like about If I Die, obviously so I\u2019ll start singing the praises of the author and her absolute brilliant skills on world building, her ingenuity in crafting such a uniquely fascinating and original \u2018paranormal\u2019 world and writing characters that you truly have feelings for-good or bad. In Rachel\u2019s post story acknowledgements she says that this is the best of the series so far, Rachel, I AGREE!The Faery says READ THIS BOOK but only if you\u2019ve started the series!

I mean it would only seem right...This book can go alot of ways.... Todd ends up with Kaylee..Nash ends up with Sabine...Todd has been assigned to collect Sabine...Possibilities are endless. I do hope that Kaylee just dumps Nash. He is not good for her! Everything about him says selfish and undeserving. And if Rachel hooks her up with Todd, how the hell would that work? He is a Reaper. Don't see that happening. But I could see the possibility of her and Alec. That just might work... =)This is going to be a very interesting book, I can already tell."}, {"userName": "Miss Cole", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5814840-miss-cole", "userReview": "I loved this series and still do.

I think this book was my favourite of the series because there are things - which I won't spoil - that happen and I was like THANK GOD FOR THAT. Seriously. I tore through most of this book in a couple of hours and could not get enough. Kaylee remains a consistently strong character while she fights for whats right, even when dealing with her own impending death. All of our favourite characters remain, and I think what I liked most about this book was while Averi was still very much a thought in the back of Kaylee's head, he wasn't the main plot of this story nor the antagonist. There was so much in this novel that reminded me why I love this series. I commend Vincent.While our favourite cast of characters are still themselves, they grow and develop further and make mistakes that show that they are human (or nearly human, anyway!) What I have to keep reminding myself is that they are 16 and this series takes place within one school year. This is quite rare in a series. My favourite characters remain and always will be Kaylee and Todd. The ending will hurt others but please the rest. I'm not going to say which category I fall under.I can say though that the next book is going to be ON FIRE. Seriously. The way this one ended paves a dramatic arc of plots that could happen in the rest of the series. Tell me there's more. There is more, right?Oh and Todd? HOTTER THAN EVER. And I actually began to like Sabine in this book too, which is definitely saying something.I feel like I can't properly review this book without spoiling things so I'm not going to say anything else until after the book has been released. Watch this space!Fans of this series WILL NOT be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Lorena", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4363382-lorena", "userReview": "I have placed this book on my \"disheartened\" list. I want to give this book a one star but I can't force myself. I've been in love with the series from the start and the thought and idea behind the book were solid and enjoyable. I liked the tension Kaylee dying and the incubus plot added. I found it a rather unique idea. So why disheartened you may ask?I honestly felt that the Nash and Kaylee situation was badly handled and written in this book. We have five books for Kaylee and Nash struggling to find them selves and fighting to save their love. In If I die, One second Kaylee is learning to trust and love Nash again, in a real relationship, and five pages later she is all over Todd. Whom she had no idea had feelings for her, we never really see her liking Todd beyond friendship but in a flat second he turns into a big love interest that was meant to be? Unrealistic...I am incredibly disappointed in Rachel Vincent for what she did to Nash and Todd. Todd DIED for his brother and now he is cheating with his girlfriend? Does that sound like something someone who sacrificed his life do to the person he saved? Doubtful..Lastly, I was absolutely appalled at how Rachel Vincent wrote Nash into being a abusive, crazy manipulative psycho JUST to make us more willing to swallow Kaylee and Todd in this book. Now I wouldn't have blamed NASH for leaving Kaylee considering she dropped him when he needed her the most but I won't go into that. Overall, I feel like Rachel Vincent didn't stay true to the characters personalities and development that was shown in all the previous books.*sigh* Not sure I will be reading the next book."}, {"userName": "Chrissy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2587132-chrissy", "userReview": "Oh. My. Tod. This book was amazing! Killer plot, new evil beings, complex relationships, and a literal life-or-death situation. I absolutely devoured it. And the ending....holy Tod, the ending. I did not expect what happened, yet it was completely fitting. I am so excited for the next installment of this series. One of the strengths of the Soul Screamers series is the cast of characters. There are a lot of them, and Rachel Vincent doesn't forget about them or make them disappear. She weaves them through each story, while also adding new ones for us to learn about. The complexity of several of these relationships was highlighted throughout If I Die. The challenges in each relationship made all the other events of the book more interesting.I really appreciated that Avari wasn't the main bad guy in this book. Don't get me wrong, the hellion is a crazy good villain, but he's been the main one in the last few books and I was eager for a change or a new angle. While not out of the picture, If I Die wasn't focused on him. And Tod. *swoons* It's no secret that I'm in love with Tod, but man, I didn't think it was possible to love him even more. If I Die totally does that. As with the previous books, his presence and page time has grown and I liked what I saw (read?). I won't give anything away, but let's just say Tod delivers all the snarky, quick-witted humor I needed, while still being the loyal, caring friend.Overall rating: Buy the whole series."}], "description": "The entire school's talking about the gorgeous new math teacher, Mr. Beck.
