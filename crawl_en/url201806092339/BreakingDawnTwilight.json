That being said, let me begin by saying that when I first read Twilight, I was hooked. I read New Moon in one sitting. I awaited the release of Eclipse with great anticipation. Sadly, Eclipse was the beginning of the end. It left me disappointed enough not to have high expectations for Breaking Dawn. Even at that, Breaking Dawn shattered my lowest expectations. I am stunned at the depths to which this once-revered author has plunged! From this point on I will refer to Breaking Dawn as B.D., aka \u201cBitter Disappointment,\u201d or, if you prefer, \u201cBoring Depravity,\u201d \u201cBloody Drama,\u201d \u201cBrain Drain,\u201d or my husband\u2019s personal favorite, \u201cBloody Diapers\u201d.Where do I begin? How about with my least favorite character, Bella? She began the series with a lot of promise. Sure, some people said that she wasn\u2019t well defined in the first book, but I never had a problem with her. Throughout New Moon and Eclipse, her character starts to decline. In B.D., Bella becomes intolerable. This girl is unbelievably selfish. She begins the book whining about the beautiful, expensive car Edward bought her. She whines about the wedding preparations, the dress, the ring. Poor thing has to *gasp* marry the man of her dreams! The injustice! She is far more concerned about nameless, faceless people mocking her for getting married young than she is about the happiness of the man she claims to love more than life itself. And her treatment of Jacob! Where to begin? This is a good kid had the misfortune to fall in love with her and though I had issues with his manipulation of her emotions at the end of Eclipse, still, he\u2019s a teenage guy and you have to cut him some slack. But come on, Bella! Once she realizes she loves him, but that she loves Edward more, she chooses Edward. Fine. So let the poor guy go! Let him move on with his life! But no, she has to have her cake and eat it too. She hurts both Edward, the one she has chosen, and Jacob, the one she has rejected, by refusing to cut ties with him. She claims to hate herself for hurting him, says at one point that it\u2019s \u201ccriminal\u201d to injure him as much as she does, but will she love him enough to let him let go and move on? Nope. She wouldn\u2019t \u201cfeel whole\u201d without him, so she continues to cling to him. Even after she\u2019s married. The culmination of this extreme selfish lack of consideration for anyone\u2019s feelings but her own is when she slips and refers to the unborn baby as \u201cEJ\u201d. Did she even think to consider whether Edward would be happy about having his child named after his rival? No, she just did what she darn well wanted to do, and gave no thought to what Edward would want. Bella has become a tyrant. What Queen Bella wants, Queen Bella must have.Now, a little bit about Edward. He was what made Twilight so magical. He was mysterious, romantic, beautiful, all the many things that the hero of a good book should be. Edward stole the hearts of most of the female readers of this series. Yet, by the time you finish B.D., you find yourself either feeling terribly sorry for him because he chose such a lame heroine, or just contemptuous of him for becoming a doormat, a slave to Bella\u2019s whims. I thought I\u2019d scream if I had to hear him say \u201cIf it makes her happy, I\u2019ll do it, even if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for her\u201d one more time. In B.D., the author sends the message through Edward that love and blind devotion are the same thing. They aren\u2019t. Truly loving someone isn\u2019t giving them free reign to stomp all over you and everything in their path, just because they think it will make them happy. Real love encompasses the occasional appropriate guidance of the loved one away from self-destructive desires toward a better way. But here, we are taught that if you love someone, you let them have what they want, all the time, without exception.As for the story development, my greatest frustration is that the author created a very intricate world, complete with detailed descriptions of what could and could not happen in it. Then she decided not to play by these rules. Yes, I am referring to the sudden and inexplicable ability of a vampire to father a child. This felt very contrived and unbelievable, and introduced such a bizarre, nightmarish chain of events that I could hardly believe I was reading the story that began as Twilight. This baby feeds on the blood of its mother and slowly sucks her life away? Bella has to drink human blood, while she\u2019s still human, to save her life and the life of her child? And she LIKES IT? This is the same, human Bella that turned green and almost passed out while doing blood typing in Biology class, right? Okay, I could see that her aversion to blood was going to go away after becoming a vampire. But while she was still human? Really? I felt sick the whole time I read about her drinking gallons of blood a day to sustain the child. Bleh. I still don\u2019t get the whole scene where Edward asks Jacob to offer to make babies with Bella. What?!? Again, is this the author\u2019s attempt at showing us the extent of true love? It was twisted and disturbing.And the delivery of the baby\u2026that was just plain disgusting. Bella vomiting gallons of blood, her bones snapping right and left, blood vessels popping in her eyes, Edward biting into her womb to get the baby out, and the tender moment when mommy sees baby for the first time is marred by said baby taking a bite out of her mommy. Ick! And I\u2019ll just join the legions of people who are saying, \u201cRENESMEE?!?\u201d You\u2019ve got to be kidding. This from the author who tastefully chose names like Edward, Bella, Carlisle, Alice\u2026why didn\u2019t she just name her \u201cBrangelina\u201d or \u201cTomKat\u201d? Or \u201cBedward?\u201d I will also join the protests against Jacob imprinting on Bella and Edward\u2019s daughter. I could see when the concept of imprinting was introduced that it would be the author\u2019s way of making a happy ending for Jacob at the end of the story, and that was fine. I like a happy ending, and of course I wanted to see Jacob happy. But are we so inflexible that we can\u2019t be happy with Jacob imprinting on a nice, new girl to the story? No, Bella must have her way. She can\u2019t be happy without Jacob as a part of her life. And we\u2019re supposed to feel happy and satisfied that she gets her way in the form of Jacob as her son-in-law? How is that a happy ending?At the top of my list of grievances is the destruction of the message that was communicated so clearly in the first three books. Once Bella falls in love with Edward, she is confronted with some very difficult choices. If she wants to be with Edward, she must choose to leave human life behind her and become a vampire. The value of Eclipse was that it forced Bella to look long and hard at what she was choosing if she decided to become a vampire. She would have to cut ties with her human life\u2026her mother, father, and everyone human that mattered to her. She could never have children of her own. She would have to deal with the bloodlust of being a newborn vampire. She would spend a significant amount of time developing the self-control and restraint that the rest of the Cullens had achieved. One of the most compelling elements of the first three books is Edward\u2019s angst, his agonizing about the state of his soul as a vampire. He grieves what he sees as the loss of his soul. This is at the heart of his great reluctance to change Bella, the reason for his disappearance in New Moon. All the vampires who have chosen not to feed on humans hate what they have become. They are conflicted about who they are. None of them who remember life as a human can say with conviction that they wouldn\u2019t go back if they could. Bella has to confront all of this and choose to sacrifice the value of her humanity for the love she feels for Edward. All of this is well and good and presents a very thought-provoking storyline. Then, in B.D., every one of these issues is neatly sidestepped in order to create an obstacle-free path to a happily-ever after ending for Queen Bella. First of all, from the moment she opens her eyes as a newborn vampire, everything is better. The world shimmers. She experiences everything so much more intensely, things are more beautiful, more colorful, more wonderful. What\u2019s not to love about being a vampire? Within minutes, she is exhibiting the self-control that everyone else took decades to achieve. And how about the whole I-have-to-have-sex-before-I-become-a-vampire-because-all-my-human-emotions-will-be-gone-for-awhile? Nope! Not only does she still experience all the emotions and passions she had as a human, but they are intensified! By the time we\u2019re finished reading about Bella\u2019s new life as a vampire, we have to wonder why anyone wouldn\u2019t want to be a vampire. All the build-up for Bella to grow and mature through sacrifice and self-denial, wiped away. So much better for her not to have to suffer through that stuff, right? And she manages to get immortality and a baby, to boot. We have to wonder if everyone who claimed that becoming a vampire was a serious, heavy choice was just delusional. The nobility of the message is sacrificed in order to create a neat, happy ending for everyone.I haven\u2019t seen much, if any, speculation on what the cover of the book is trying to communicate to the reader, so here\u2019s my take. The big white queen is, you guessed it, Queen Bella, the white vampire. The red pawn is you (or I), the blood-red reader, about to be sucked dry in the wake of the Queen\u2019s destruction. Beware!I wish Stephenie Meyer had ended with Twilight or at least an extended version of New Moon. I think I\u2019ll be hauling my copies of the last three to the local library as a donation and trying to just enjoy Twilight for what it was before the rest of this mess came into play."}, {"userName": "Jenne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne", "userReview": "oh yes, so VERY many spoilers! and unladylike language, sorry.p.1: god help me.

This is Bella and Edward's story and Jacob is a distraction. I'm sorry that you like him too much to hurt him, but that doesn't mean you have to ruin the story for him, much less give him half the book. Making Bella still love him hurts them all, makes her self-centered, and Edward seem an indulgent parent with a whiny brat he can't say no to. It diminishes their love to volley back and forth. Everyone I love together? I don't buy it. Bella said goodbye to Jacob in Eclipse; leave it at that. Sacrifice for Edward. That's love. Bella's treatment of Edward (and Jacob) is only as infuriating as his indulgence of it. His idea for resolution of her nudger (gag!) is ghastly. For a second I thought Meyer was going to go down that road and I was sickened. How in anyone's mind is offering your wife up to another man shows undying love is beyond me. It is sick and wrong. And how is insemination gross or worse that pimping her out? How can Bella never consider Edward's worry for her? She knows how she'd feel if he died. Bella seemed more like Wanda in The Host: trying to portray her as too kind which is just blindly selfish. She should have written The Host after and not confused the stories or writing style. The characters have wandered so far from their original shells that I couldn't branch this story to the magic of Twilight. Where were Edward and Bella? And the rest of the Cullens?The way Meyer transfers Jacob from one obsession to another while not extreme to be pedophile is still creepy, much worse considering Jacob's comment about seeing Bella naked or that Bella's eyes caused the imprint. This is not a southern joke where your father is your uncle and your grandpa too. It doesn't excuse Bella's unhealthy possession of him and it doesn't smooth over the hatred with Edward. My brother, my son? Gag. His intrusion in the happy family of three was beyond grating. He doesn't get a say in how that child is raised. And is Renesmee seriously supposed to grow up and love a guy who raised her? That's disturbing. Why couldn't Jacob and Leah be happy together instead of Meyer making all of her relationships the older man with a young girl? The story was going that way, but Meyer had reserved this sick end for Jacob she found romantic so she forced it onto the story. Werewolf imprint on vampire hybrid? That makes no sense, especially after Leah's discussion about imprinting on the best mate to keep the race alive. As much as I didn't like the extent Jacob was in the book, the other vampires were more disappointing. All the old albeit shallow side characters were replaced with a freak show. I thought this was a book about vampires not superheros? The abundant \"rare\" gifts got more ridiculous from one to the next--at least the original gifts connected to human traits. And the flaws. Alice's ineptitude at her visions was not consistent. Bella? Willpower? Bella's \"holes\" didn't make sense. How could Jasper affect her if she's that strong? Why couldn't Edward hear her inside her bubble? Everything about all these extra vampires was just wrong. Hundreds of vampires on a feeding frenzy without the Volturi reducing numbers didn't make sense. She should have stuck to developing the Cullens. And Bella. The second half was so out of character I couldn't take that disjointed leap with her.I was so disappointed with the lengthy Volturi scene, the only thing with any hope of excitement that only built and tiringly built and then fizzled. These were the only vampires sold as creepy monsters and while their mafia-type support didn't make sense, I still expected them to act out the role. They didn't deliver. The story was so far gone by that point, I half expected the spawn of Satan (and by that I mean Renesmee) to destroy the Volturi alone. It seemed more \"The Incredibles\" than Bella and Edward at that point so why not a Jack-Jack ending? It didn't resolve anything and only put them in graver danger but she still shoved a happily ever after down our throats.Vampires (dead humans with extra chromosomes?) don't have blood; they don't drink, pee, sweat, or have liquid in their bodies. Beyond the complications of sex for those reasons (which I wouldn't have questioned if that's as far as it went) or the likelihood of Rosemary's baby, don't turn the monster into an angel more werewolf than vampire. It's a confusing stretch. You know in soap operas where babies get in the way of the storyline so they magically grow up so the parents don't have to deal with childhood? Sacrifice is what gives you undying love for children; they are not convenient plot ideas. Nothing about that child made sense and I thought Nessie, considering its monster ties, was a vast improvement on a ridiculous name. And Edward Jacob for a boy is not sweet. It's obscenely selfish. The point at which I started hating this book was when Bella didn't even act like a vampire. Not being a newborn vampire is not a gift, particularly for a vampire who needs a myriad of other gifts to save the story. It's an excuse to not have your characters suffer. But instead of making characters stronger, it weakens them. It robs them. It robs us of a good story. You can't soften that blow. Hiding the pain of the bite from Edward robbed him of a chance for compassion--something dependent Bella would not do. Turning to the person you love most in your worst hour is love, is what strengthens relationships. And how is Bella's human uterus so strong that only a vampire could cut through it with his teeth? That was about the biggest joke in the book. Being a \"soulless\" newborn vampire isn't all Meyer cracked it up to be. If it were, they never would have let a strong newborn go hunting with only one guardian. Since Bella was so easily distracted from a thirst that didn't seem all that powerful, there should have been some good loving in that forest. Having the thirst that drives the series not phase her, diminishes its power and intrigue for all vampires, all the way back to Twilight. Being a vampire isn't torture; it's fun. I want to be a superhero vampire. Sacrifice is what Bella knew she was undertaking when she picked Edward. But she gave up nothing. Everything is twisted for the sake of convenience: children, newborn desire, imprinting, human family, death, special gifts, a cast of new vampires, everything. Would a cop who detaches his daughter's battery so she doesn't sneak out plead \"don't ask, don't tell\" with the scary supernatural threatening his community and daughter? The only reason this bogus aspect is even in the story is because Meyer couldn't bare for Bella to lose anything. But if Edward, Bella, and Jacob are unrecognizable characters, why not Charlie? And if Charlie gets pulled into the story why not her mother? I'm sure Meyer could have come with an implausible excuse for her too.Meyer tried to add plot twists, but couldn't commit to their consequences. With all the conflict removed for Bella, there is no drama so Meyer tries to create it with ill-placed childish mood swings. There are no monsters in the book. Vampires are sparkly happy supermodels. Werewolves are snuggly tame pets. Even the werewolf-vampire antagonism seems to have dissipated. The head-butting between Rosalie and Jacob seems more personality conflict than the innate drive to destroy each other. They all want to sit around the campfire and sing. Couldn't at least some Volturi sinister be burning in that fire?

When you create a book series, there tends to be an issue with the next book that comes out in the series having to be better than the last. Of course that is always a possibility for stories such as Harry Potter, where the plot is laced through all of the books and leads to an ultimate climax and resolution in the final book. Stephenie Meyer did not follow this example in any way, shape, or form.Instead of possibly creating an internal plot that would follow the entire series, every book has...well, I cannot justify a plot in any of the books, save the first one (that was in the last 100 pages of the book), so I'll try to skim sweetly over this. For her last attempt, strike 4 on my count, Meyer rides this train till there are no more tracks; taking the train, and all of it's passengers on a bumpy, uncomfortable, and unforgivable journey no one had prepared for.Bella's half-breed child shouldn't even exist, given Meyer's specific \"VAMPIRES CANNOT HAVE CHILDREN\", so of course she gives a pathetic, if not confusing, explanation to how Edward gets Bella pregnant. The child's name itself is atrocious; I honestly hope no one loves this series enough to name their own child that, out of their \"love for Stephenie Meyer.\"Let's remember what I said before: there is not a sustaining plot throughout these books, besides the fact that Bella wants to become a vampire; but even that is stretching it. So when Bella becomes pregnant, it's almost as if Meyer suddenly thought, \"PLOT!\" and took off at the speed of light in a direction that flabbergasted me. Has she even mentioned children in this entire book series? Besides the fact that little mutant Nessie takes the entire stage, Bella's giving birth to a mutant that should not exist (X-Men anyone?) seems to be the only thing that drives this story forward. Because otherwise, the story would have ended. Bella got married, Bella somehow someway got pregnant, Bella had a half-breed baby, Bella becomes a vampire, Jacob creepily imprints on said baby, and everyone lives freakishly happily ever after. I shouldn't have to describe how horrific it is that the entire 800-pages of the final novel is about a baby. Bella seemed to move to Forks and somehow grow up in a year, getting married and having a baby, and living for forever with her ridiculously good-looking husband. I understand that Bella made the choice for herself, doesn't mean I have to think it was a good one. Or a good example for young girls to follow. I'm not going to step up on the soap box and preach about how many horrible morals this gives to girl's of today's generation (after feminism has fought to get us this far) because if they haven't read a cheap romance novel yet, they certainly will. Guys looking to date girls of that generation should beware however. If you don't sparkle in the sun, devote every step you take and every move you make to her, and like to watch her sleep, you might not have much of a chance.But, back to the story, cough, I mean lack thereof. The Volturi coming in deemed itself, once again, random and overreaching for Meyer. As if she just wanted them to show up and have an epic battle, but it wasn't really epic and it didn't serve much of a point. However, if I was a 1000-year-old vampire, I'm sure I'd be bored enough to care about someone as trivial as Bella Swan too.1/3 of the novel is in Jacob's perspective, and to be honest, that was the one part I enjoyed (somewhat). Only because I think Jacob was Meyer's best character. He shall forever be known as the character with a personality. However, as Meyer had introduced me to Jacob, and gave me reason to like him, she also had the power to do the opposite. Thank you, Stephenie Meyer for ruining one of the only realistic characters you created. *two thumbs way down* Not only did Jacob CREEP me out, he was so completely overbearing and whiny, I couldn't wait to get back to Bella, the whining queen! His imprinting on little Nessie just put the icing on the shit-cake I had been eating for the past 400 pages. I had assumed we went passed the pedophilia part with Quil, and come on, he imprinted on EDWARD AND BELLA'S BABY? Why couldn't he have imprinted on a 35-year-old alcoholic with an abusive husband and Meyer could give someone who needs saving a fighting chance by someone with super powers. By this point, I was going to take an example from New Moon and jump off a cliff just to save myself from the rest of the book.But I didn't, and I should have. The rest of the book was almost as boring and laughable as the first half, but at least the first half had (gasp) fade-to-black sensual scenes.As many people have been saying, this book is exactly like 1,000 stories on FanFiction.net--and if I can give you any advice, find a story on there and it might be a lot better than reading this.And it would probably be 700 pages less."}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "Robert Pattinson hates Twilight so much, it's hysterical.Interviewer: \u201cMillions of Twilight fans, they cannot wait to see this, it\u2019s almost heartbreaking because they don\u2019t want it to be over.

I LOVED this book. It was even better than I even imagined. So many surprises! I picked mine up at midnight when it was released and could hardly put it down. So first off...the wedding was beautiful. The honeymoon was even better. Stephenie Meyer did an amazing job of writing a \"tasteful\" honeymoon scene. It wasn't dirty at all. It was beautiful. You knew they were able to have sex and that there was a definate strong \"intensity\" during these moments but she didn't go into too many explicit details which leaves much to the imagination (I loved the quote by Bella, \"Why am I covered in feathers?\"). It was PG-13. Plus they were married when it happened so that made it even better. I have to admit I was a little shocked she wrote the sex parts. I didn't think she would go there but I am so glad she did because it just made the bond between Edward and Bella even stronger if that was even possible. It was hot and sexy for sure! I am so happy Edward and Bella got their proper wedding & honeymoon and more importantly....that I got to read about it like I was right there! Does that make me a pervert? Oh who cares! It was amazing!So what I never dreamed of happening was a pregnancy! This is when the story goes from pure happiness to total uncertainty and even sadness for some. Bella is adamant that she would keep the baby even though it was killing her, hoping she could keep her heart beating long enough so she could be turned into a vampire to save her. I have never felt so horrible for Edward. To say he was in agony would be an understatement. Chapter 9 was very hard for me to read because Edward was in so much pain. Pain isn\u2019t even close to describing what he was feeling. Not that I doubted before but it was in this chapter that really solidified that Edward would do ANYTHING for Bella no matter how much pain it caused him. Pain he feels he deserves. I felt awful for him.Chapter 18...the birth was by far the most intense chapter of all the books in the series for me. I was literally shaking as I read it. It was pretty graphic with Bella\u2019s bones cracking and breaking, her spine shattering, throwing up all the blood she had been drinking to feed her unborn child. She was dying. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if they would be able to save the baby and at the same time save her. I always hoped Bella would become a vampire but I always had this feeling that Stephenie wouldn\u2019t let that happen. I am so happy I was wrong. One of my favorite parts from the chapter was when Jacob was giving Bella CPR after the baby was born\u2026.\u201cMove your hands, Jacob,\u201d\tI looked up from Bella\u2019s white eyes, still pumping her heart for her. Edward had a syringe in his hand-all silver, like it was made from steel.\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\tHis stone hand knocked mine out of the way. There was a tiny crunch as his blow broke my little finger. In the same second, he shoved the needle straight into her heart.\t\u201cMy venom,\u201d he answered as he pushed the plunger down.You could feel that at this moment Edward was very somber. He was turning the woman he loved into a vampire. Something he had fought against for a long time because he didn't want her to have to give up any human experiences and eventually regret becoming a vampire. Now he did it to save her. There was no other way. I wish I could have been in his head at this time though it would have been very depressing I'm sure. Jacob too had to give in to letting her become a vampire to save her.So now not only was Bella changed into a vampire, but she was a mother and a wife. So many changes so fast. This all shocked me but nothing shocked me more than when Jacob imprints on Bella & Edward\u2019s baby...Renesmee(not fond of the name...but thank goodness it wasn't an Edward Jacob! That name irritated me even more). I have to admit though it kinda freaked me out at first. I don't blame Bella for wanting to tear him apart. Like me I don't think she could have ever imagined this happening. This event was so significant. It released all the pain Jacob had to endure by being in love with Bella but knowing she would never be his. At the same time it tied him to her permanently. He still loved her but in the way it should have always been. He loved her as a friend and nothing more. Also with her change into a vampire & birth of Renesmee brought a release from the pull she felt to have Jacob as part of her life, though he would still be because of the whole imprinting thing but it would never complicate things between her and Edward\u2019s relationship again which I was very grateful for. She loved him as a brother like she always wanted. Everything was as it should be.So in the end the challenge was the Volturi. They were coming to kill all of them because they believed Edward & Bella had created a youngling. Changed a child into a vampire when really Renesmee was the biological child of Edward and Bella. I cried (the ugly kind, I was hysterical) at a point when Edward and Bella said their quiet goodbyes to their daughter and Jacob when they thought they were about to die. It was heart wrenching. It was so touching when Edward said to Jacob, \"Goodbye Jacob, my brother.....my son.\" What a wonderful gesture from Edward to Jacob. Luckily in the end they were able to conquer because of Bella and her amazing gift to shield everyone she loved from the \"special\" gifts of the Volturi. I thought it was wonderful to see Bella so powerful and strong. That for once she was able to be the protector instead of the one being protected. She got to be the savior. This too made the unbreakable bond between her and Edward stronger. Because of her they were able to beat the Volturi and save their daughter that they loved more than anything. Their family was intact. One of my absolute favorite parts (there are so many I have to say) was at the end when Bella removes her \"shield\" so Edward can read her thoughts. Edward was NOT expecting this. Not being able to all this time has driven him mad at times. Especially when it came to Jacob. He always wondered if Bella made the right decision. Now he knows without a doubt that she always loved him and that nothing can or ever will change that. Edward got to experience all the feelings she had for him as far back as she could remember. He can know now without a doubt that they truly belong together. What a wonderful gift to give Edward. Oh I just LOVE Edward! That Bella is one lucky vampire. I was so glad this book had the Happily Ever After ending. Especially after all the horrible things that have occured in the past. Everything came together beautifully. I loved it. I liked Jacob a lot more in this book in fact I laughed out loud several times at him. I also liked Bella a lot more when she became a vampire. She wasn't as selfish and winey. I wanted to strangle her at times in the other books because of the way she treated Edward and even Jacob. The pain she caused both of them in the past because of her own selfish desires. Everything for the characters is balanced or in line how it should be in their relationships. I feel closer with the story now which I needed badly. These books totally consumed me to say the least. This was my favorite of the series by far. It was filled with love, suspense, true friendship, loyalty, sorrow, happiness and so much more. I look forward to reading it again! I don't think I will ever be able to find a series again that has affected me like this. These books are my favorites above all others!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/911195-james", "userReview": "Reviewer update Aug 2009: I have demoted the book from 5 to 4 stars. My confession/explanation is at the end of the original, unedited review.___Yes, I gave it 5-stars. This is partly because I was so pleased by it compared to the last two books in the series that I overreacted. But I also approve of her approach to the book and have rated it so highly in order to counteract those reviewers out there who hated it because they felt Bella was a bad example to young girls.***THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS SPOIL THINGS THAT HAPPEN EARLY IN THE BOOK***I have a bone to pick with these people. Read some of the reviews on Amazon or GoodReads and you will find a certain type of person who feels that Bella's character fails as a role model for young women today. Why? Because she, gasp, got married and had a child at a young age.Oh, my, what is the world coming to when young people choose eternal love and devotion! (Oh that more young women could be more like the implausibly articulate yet utterly selfish lead in the movie Juno!) In my favorite example, one reviewer on Amazon claimed it wasn't credible that a girl as young as Bella would feel joy at sensing a baby growing inside her. \"I'm 28 and if I felt something moving in me, I would freak,\" she said, \"I can't believe a 19-year old would be happy about it.\"***END OF SPOILAGE***Sadness ensues. Women and men from every culture in every era of history have found a tremendous and peculiar satisfaction in their children. It doesn't matter where you believe this instinct came from, it's real and it manifests millions of times over. Should we be so surprised that Stephenie Meyer would be one of the billions who believe this love to be real? Read the author's bio and it becomes clear: She was married at 21 before she finished college and had three children while still in her 20s. But one can hardly call her a \"failure\" for choosing family first. By all standards she's fabulously successful and wealthy. Plus, she has a college degree (one of the big beefs some people had with Bella's choice to postpone college). Are we really surprised that Stephenie would see the world through rose-colored, happiness-prone glasses when her own life is exactly that, deliriously happy?Social polemics aside for a moment. The one thing this book lacked was a satisfying climactic, apocalyptic battle royale between the forces of vampire good and vampire evil. I know this book was intended to cap off a romance series, not \nThe Lord of the Rings\n but there's a reason books of high fantasy all end in cataclysmic bloodshed. It takes a conflict of such dramatic proportions to drive the point of a story deep into our minds. And the point of this story, if you weren't too focused on your own family planning to notice it, was worthy of such dramatic punctuation. The real point of this book is that we can and should choose love. That despite our personal weaknesses and faults -- our immature attempts at love and our petty jealousies -- we can make important, permanent decisions that will tie us to other people, making their lives and our lives better in the process. The battle I propose -- one I hope sees the light of day in a future novel -- would seal Bella's decisions and the decisions of her family and loved ones in a way that would render their commitments real. Their marital love, their parental love, their familial love, and the love of fellowship with others who share their principles.Some would have to die to preserve the love they have made immortal. Others would have to kill to do the same. Nothing is more final, especially for immortals. But they would do so to symbolize the triumph of their love over the petty dynasty of the Volturi and thus establish a global movement of vampires that respect human life and restrain their selfish hungers in deference to the greater good. Something that wise humans do every day. Such a symbolic battle would take this series to the next level. But even without it, this book is the best evidence that Meyer wasn't really writing a sloppy romance saga for misty-eyed girls, but was instead telling a story about the eternal power of love and self-denial. ___Update from Aug 2009I have had some fabulous comments to my review (please read them, most are very intelligent). I have been properly chided by many of these reviews for overreacting to the \"Bella is a bad role model\" flack and failing to acknowledge the principal flaw of this book. Amy said it best below: Meyer shortchanged us by not forcing Bella to face any hard choices. Bella got everything she wanted, including a (strange) relationship with Jacob. Nobody she loved got hurt -- which was the problem I did mention above -- and she never had to disappoint anyone. Given that a year has passed, I have some distance on all the whining that went on about Bella not being a protofeminist. As a result, I should own up to the fact that this fourth book fails to deliver not only the climax I hoped for, but the real character crisis and development that a saga of this length should strive for. Or that we all should strive for in our own lives, to go all metaphysical on you for a moment. So I have demoted the book from 5 stars to 4 and begun to ruminate on the topic of why Meyer -- a woman possessed of such clear imagination -- was unwilling or unable to make Bella's life hard. Here's what I have come up with, for what it's worth:1 - Meyer's own life is pretty darn pleasant. Let's be honest, she has everything most people think they want. All of us who struggle to write books that nobody reads desperately wish for her success (a fact that generates more than few snippy comments on Goodreads, I might suggest). She has a whole community of women around her who adore her and come to all-night parties when she debuts a book or movie, just to be near her. In the end, she might make Bella after her own image because she doesn't know that life ultimately requires pain. 2 - Meyer is a Mormon. For those not acquainted with the faith, Mormonism is a faith that believes everything will ultimately be okay. If not in this life, then in the next. In fact, the whole vampire immortality gig is just a metaphor for the Mormon idea of the afterlife: You get to be with the ones you love forever, without pain. In that way, Bella is a perfect reflection of the ideal Mormon eternity: God forgives us for our idiocy, acknowledges our flawed attempts at love by magnifying them and making them eternal. Though this is only one side of Mormonism -- it's also a faith with sorrowful history of persecution. Mormons certainly suffer plenty in this life just like everyone else, so this explanation is only true to the extent that Meyer has willingly isolated Mormonism's view of the end state of humanity. 3 - Twilight is just escapist fantasy. This is not only the most obvious but probably the strongest of my three explanations. We're so accustomed to watching James Bond run through the street with machine guns trained on him that never hit their mark that we no longer point out that Bond is completely implausible and ultimately unsatisfying as a character. But we're not used to reading fiction in which women get everything they want. (At least, I'm not.) So we get tied up in knots about the lack of deeper meaning and pathos when in reality, Meyer never promised us a garden of sorrow and personal growth. So even though I have to demote the book, I still feel like the saga was worth reading; both because of the fun I had teasing about its flaws but also because it gives me fodder for worthwhile introspection. Oh, and it connected me to some great commenters who I now follow on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "SR", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272092-sr", "userReview": "Page 318 - Had her body changed because she was a werewolf?

I am beyond disgusted at this. (edit - this is kind of unclear, mostly because at the time of typing I was too angry to think properly. I'm disgusted at the statement that women who cannot have children are less than female, with the implication that the only point of being a woman is reproduction. Which is bullshit. Families are great and all, but they are not the be-all-end-all of my double X's, and sterility does not change one's femininity. Blah.)Yeah, finished - well, meh. Writing was better, but by the end none of the characters were recognizable except Alice - ILU ALICE - and Bella became even more of a Mary Sue than she had been before, which I think managed to break part of the universe. Death Baby was annoying, Edward and Jacob both came over all woobie, and the ending was the BIGGEST FUCKING COP-OUT.

That whole mess with chromosomes, and how vampires have 25 and humans have 23 which is why Alice can see their futures but she can't see werewolves' futures because they have 24, and the reason she can't see the bb is because it has the average of Bella and Edward - what the hell is that?

Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse can stand together as a fairly pleasing, lovable trio. Breaking Dawn seems almost unrelated to the series, like some crazed, over-the-top fan fiction. In the first three books, Stephenie Meyer creates this world of seemingly realistic magic \u2013 realistic because it is bound by explainable rules, and the characters within the world have retainable qualities from book to book. Though New Moon shows how utterly weak and pathetic Bella is sans Edward, it seems a natural progression of her needy personality that was introduced during the development of their relationship in Twilight. It seems as if in Breaking Dawn, Stephenie Meyer ran out of ideas for her characters or else decided to completely remake them and ignore the logistics she created for these magical creatures. It might as well have been named Breaking Rules.First let\u2019s start off with Bella\u2019s personality. Though her aversion to the wedding ceremony is over-done and her self-deprecating attitude by this point is impossibly trite, it seems like the classic Bella. By the time she finishes her honeymoon with Edward, she has gone from being this average teenager who is in love enough to marry her boyfriend but doesn\u2019t want to jump into a marriage for fear of being thought of as \u201csmall-town\u201d, to a married, pregnant eighteen year old who is so intent upon keeping her incubus child that she is willing to die so that the thing can live. Oh, and she has also become somewhat reminiscent of a crazed sex-addict. She is annoyed that Edward wants to go out and explore the island with her, snorkeling and hiking and doing fun activities. She would rather just stay in the house and have sex all day, every day, for weeks at a time. That\u2019s disgusting. Also defying any sort of logic is the fact that once she realizes she might be pregnant, it is confirmed by the fact that her stomach has a little bulge and she feels the baby kick. The five-day-old embryo. Right. It\u2019s almost like Stephenie Meyer wanted to stuff five years of normal life into Edward and Bella\u2019s magical existence for the sake of not having to write a fifth book. Although Bella\u2019s pregnancy was a surprise to the vampire world, the event seemed utterly contrived. By the time I finished reading the honeymoon scene, I was having to shut the book to collect myself. I felt my mind had been violated, like Stephenie Meyer had just mind-raped me through nearly 100 pages. I had to force myself to continue reading. It only got worse.I was annoyed that Stephenie decided to use a whole third of the book for Jacob\u2019s perspective. What sort of structure is that? It\u2019s just a lame excuse to develop the plot from an easier angle. It\u2019s a total cop-out. Why even write a version of Twilight from Edward\u2019s perspective if you can just throw in alternate perspectives wherever it makes things easier? Once Bella becomes pregnant, she ceases to be Bella. We see most of the pregnancy through Jacob\u2019s eyes, and Bella\u2019s stubbornness is annoying. I didn\u2019t even feel compassion or sympathy for her. Edward speaks of it as a \u201cthing\u201d, Carlisle is afraid of it, they say it\u2019s an incubus and not even a real infant, that it eats its way out of its mother\u2019s womb, and yet Bella wants it, is willing to die for it. What? Since when did Bella want to be a mom? Since when did she not care about the whole \u201csmall town\u201d image? She doesn\u2019t seem to see how this child could complicate her life, much less end it. Plus, the thing grows at an alarming rate. Within a week or two, Bella\u2019s stomach is large enough that she \u201ccradles it\u201d in her arms. This image disgusted me. First of all, I would rather not imagine a pregnant 18 year old, married or not. Second of all, the logistics of it bother me. Like oh, of course she gets through 9 months of pregnancy in roughly four weeks. Way to go Stephenie, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re not anxious to speed the plot along or anything. Plus, with Bella\u2019s personality it seems like she would have a hard time wrapping her head around the idea of impending motherhood, let alone be absolutely ready for it in four weeks\u2019 time. Then the birth \u2013 grotesque, disgusting. Edward biting open Bella\u2019s womb to free the child. Um, sick? I can only hope the movie version of this saga ends with Twilight. I can't imagine them trying to dilute the honeymoon scene, let alone the birthing scene. I can just picture the awkward energy radiating in the theatre during a movie like this. I wouldn't be surprised if there were nothing but crickets at the end, moviegoers awkwardly shuffling out of the theatre, avoiding eye contact with those they came with. But moving on, how about the lovely celebrity-coupleish name they burden her with? Renesmee. Gag me. I wonder what Stephenie Meyer was even thinking. And to further her perverted, illogical tirade, Stephenie has Jacob imprint on the infant Renesmee. Wow, didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, how perfect for Bella. She can have Jacob in her life AND have him be happy. Wow. Applause. Great solution. Not. I would rather he imprinted on Leah. That would have made much more sense. Once Bella becomes a vampire, she continues to remain the exception to every rule while being utterly oblivious to the fact. Bella! You\u2019re so under control! Really? I am? What? Bella! You are unusually graceful! Really? Was that jump good? Bella! Your mind can block everything out, you have super powers! And oh, you can conveniently use them to protect the ones you love! Really? Is that good? Am I being modest enough? Gag me. How convenient to the plot that Bella can skip over all the newborn vampire nonsense and just be herself. How convenient that her passions for Edward only intensify. Who needs human experiences? How convenient that Charlie gets to know the Cullens are not human. How convenient that he happily accepts that two months after giving his daughter away, he already has a grandchild the size of a 3 year old. Right. Because infant Renesmee is not nearly as interesting or cute as talking toddler Renesmee who appears to be a baby Einstein that prefers to \u201cshow\u201d her thoughts rather than speak them. And suddenly Bella has the mental maturity of a 30 year old mother though she\u2019s still an 18 year old who got pregnant four months ago and has a daughter who is progressing at least 5 times as fast as a normal infant. The whole plot line reminded me of a child who got bored playing the same old story with her Barbies and suddenly decided that Barbie and Ken were going to have a baby, and that baby was born and became a functioning member of the family within two minutes of play time. I was a little hopeful when the Volturi arrived for what seemed to be an inevitable war. I recalled back to when Bella mentioned something about not being able to imagine the Cullens without their head, Carlisle. I thought for sure Carlisle would make some ultimate sacrifice to save Edward and Bella. At least one major casualty would have breathed some feeling into this book other than \u201ceverything is perfect because Bella and Edward defy every bit of logic.\u201d But no. In true predictable fashion, Alice returns and saves the day. Bella grows some balls and radiates her \u201cshield\u201d over everyone. Pathetic Bella, the damsel in distress, the one who always had to be protected and saved, now the one protecting and saving everyone else. How convenient. No fighting occurs, Renesmee is assured a life of immortality and will conveniently grow up extra fast for Jacob. Bella and Edward live to have more sex. Everyone lives happily ever after."}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "Oh the memories. The angsty teen memories. They're all flooding back.It should come as no surprise that I have a dark and dangerous past - I was a Twihard. I loved this series with every beat of my teenage heart. I had a poster, I had a vegetarian vampire shirt, I had a themed birthday party, and (worst of all) I did this to a book:  \n I can't even open it anymore for fear of the pages falling out and the spine splintering...yet I can't bear to throw it away.And now (ten years later), I'm revisiting the series to see how my opinion's changed over the last decade. For the most part, I still am pleasantly pleased by how much I enjoyed rereading. I very nearly memorized the series as a teen so during the reread, it was nice to see the scenes with fresh eyes after all this time. It was like visiting an old friend. However, this time around there were several moments/aspects that stood out so much clearer to adult-me:Jacob went from a lovable sidekick to a mopey and whiny teen. It wasn't unbearable, but it was so much more noticeable this round:\n\u201cWhat do I look like? The Wizard of Oz? You need a brain? You need a heart? Go ahead, take mine. Take everything I have.\u201d \n15-year-old me thought this was perfectly reasonable (and undoubtedly romantic). 25-year-old me couldn't stop noticing how he kept trying to force himself on Bella in Eclipse and then did the whole woe-is-me when Bella kept trying to tell him to stop (even when she was married.) That werewolf needed a firm kick in the teeth. AND (for the first time) I noticed how conveniently and absolutely perfect everything worked out for Bella. The sheer amount of coincidences drove me a bit bonkers: \nAnd then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.\n 15-year-old-me was so relieved that the tension/uncertainty was resolved. We could finally get those super-cute moments with the Cullen Family. 25-year-old-me kept waiting for something to happen. I mean, the first 2/3 of the book consists of Bella getting married and being pregnant.  Lots and Lots of filler-fluff. She's the calmest newborn in centuries, she makes leaps and bounds with her gift and has a super adorable precocious child. It's verging on Mary-Sue territory. \nStop being so\u2026 optimistic. It\u2019s getting on my nerves.\nMost notably, the series' end wasn't as all-consuming and life-altering as I remembered it being. I still enjoyed the series but it just doesn't hold to my memory. (I guess that's a product of growing up). I'm a bit disappointed about that. Ah well. It's still a four-star-er in my book - here's to nostalgia and memories!Audiobook CommentsFor such a popular book, you'd think the audio would be a bit better. The female voice (done by Ilyana Kadushin for Bella's parts) didn't have enough variation in tone - especially when she did male characters. Nearly every adult male had the same voice and the accents of the new/visiting vampires wasn't distinct enough. The guy voice (done by Matt Walters) was a bit better for the distinction but sounded wooden throughout the book.

What was Meyer THINKING, making it possible for Bella to be pregnant? What the hell was she thinking?Now that I read Meyer's statements more carefully, I realize that she never actually said it was impossible for a male vampire to impregnate a human girl, just that a female vampire couldn't bear children. I guess we (the readers) just jumped to conclusions with that.But regardless, I have never thought of Bella as particularly maternal. So imagine my surprise when the fried chicken she makes one day nauseates her! My reaction: \"...No! It can't be! She can't be! It's impossible, damn it!\" And then when she realizes she's late, here's my reaction: \"NOOOOOOOOOOO! NO! NO NO NO NO NO! WHAT THE HELL!\"Yes, it's that bad.And then shortly after it goes into \"Book Two,\" which is Jacob's point of view.Now, I hated Jacob. Almost. I guess it was more dislike, since I don't usually hate things. But anyways, I was expecting his view to be boring and disappointing.But as we got further into it, I started to have a better understanding of him. It was refreshing to get a glimpse into his mind, to see his feelings. I have always been one of Team Edward before now, so imagine my surprise when I realize that Jacob is now one of my favorite characters!Seth and Leah are great characters too. Leah really developed--all she needed was to be able to push away from Sam. I have always liked Leah, truthfully. But even though I liked her, I could never truthfully say she had a great personality. Breaking Dawn changed that.And in Jacob's point of view, we see how badly the pregnancy is affecting Bella--this is also a good part of the book. Too often in fan fiction I see pregnant!Bella having a blissful time. But the pain and misery of it in Breaking Dawn is absolutely wonderful. A new take on it, I thought, and my opinion of the book increased as I got to that part.But then the book just HAS to go to Bella's point of view again. And shortly after she gives birth (also plenty of pain there), she is dying, and Edward has to change her into a vampire quickly. I can't say I like the circumstances for the change, but alright. Fine. But the disappointment comes during the change.She mentions the pain, the monstrous fire that keeps licking at her skin and causing her pain at every moment. But she fails to describe it well--after a while, she's grown used to it. How exactly do you get used to being in a fire? I just don't get that. And one other fact--she stays still throughout the whole transformation. She should be screaming, thrashing about. How did she suddenly become this \"strong, silent type?\"Don't worry...one of the biggest disappointments is yet to come.She wakes up, and all her senses have been magnified: the entire world looks different. That's not the disappointment, though. The big disappointment is that there is barely any mention of thirst. Know why? Because she has this super-self-control that allows her to completely skip the typical YEARS of savageness, the newborn stage! Yes, everyone. She is that awesome.She has become a Mary-Sue. If you don't know what that is, go look it up on Wikipedia now.Is that not enough to convince you of her Sue-ness? Well, as if that's not enough, a little later she discovers that she can protect people with her mind!But that's for later. Right now, let's rewind a little bit.Remember Bella's kid? Turns out it's a girl. What's her name?Renesmee.You heard right. Renesmee.Try pronouncing that. I can think of a lot of mispronunciations: REEN-smee, REH-neh-smee, etc etc. Correct pronunciation: ruh-NEZ-may. Combo of Renee and Esme.And as if that were not enough, she's nicknamed after the loch ness monster.And as if THAT, were not enough, Jacob imprints on her.Ugh. I mean, most of us want him to eventually get over Bella, right? But the way Meyer does it? It's like, POOF! The moment he sees Renesmee, Bella vanishes! She was never there!It's laughable.Using such an easy way of getting rid of Jacob. Ugh. Meyer could've at least spent time on the solution.Meanwhile, a series of events which I don't feel like explaining happen which lead the Volturi to come to try to kill Nessie. Nessie is Renesmee, if you can't figure it out. Concerned, the Cullens gather seventeen other freaking vampires as witnesses. Don't ask me for what, I don't feel like explaining.And obviously all of these vampires get along, even though most of them prey on humans and a whole neighborhood of them live a few miles away.And as if that weren't enough, almost all of them have superpowers, completely deflating one of Meyer's earlier claims.So here they are, all gathered, when suddenly the Volturi get convinced that Nessie is not a threat and they all leave peacefully--though not without killing Irina, who ratted all of them out but did so on a false claim.And then they lived happily ever after.Yes, that really happened. The title of the last chapter was even \"Happily Ever After.\"Personally, I would've liked to see a fight at the end.But then, even after all this, you still say, \"But at least Alice was there to make the story better, right?\"Well, no. She was barely there for anything. Which takes away a lot of the series' appeal.And while we're on the topic of characters, may I also add that no one was acting in-character?And while we're on the topic of out-of-character-ness, I would also like to say that Charlie found out about werewolves and that the Cullens weren't human (he doesn't know they're vampires, just that they aren't human), but guess what? He barely cares about it! Who would've thought?Remember earlier, when I said this was like a bad fan fiction? Let's weigh all the characteristics.Everything that happened in cliche fan fiction happened here, including:- Pregnant Bella- Stupid names- OOC-ness (Out Of Character, if you can't figure it out)- The commonness of gifted vampires- Bella's self-control gift- Two gifts for Bella- Jacob imprinting- Charlie knowing the secretI'm sure there's more, but I don't want to think a lot.Please don't read this.August 30th, 2008 UPDATE:Okay, so I've gotten over the initial shock of the book. I'm not going to write another review, because I'm still in denial that the book was actually okay. So I'm just going to say that I respect it. I'm never, ever going to like it, of course. But I respect it.October 4th, 2008 UPDATE:I changed my mind. I hate this book again with a passion. I no longer respect it or Meyer."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "I'll preface by saying that I did enjoy this book - I love the story overall, and the characters, and the premise and all of that. I don't have a problem with Bella, and it was funny seeing her through Jacob's biased eyes - on the contrary, I like Bella. I wouldn't be able to read these books if I didn't. What really bothers me most about this series are the obsessive fans.This is one of those series where the obsessive fans take the story away from the author, writing their own versions, coming up with their own theories and all the rest of it. I don't begrudge them that, but what really annoys me is when they say that Meyer has it all wrong, that that's not what vampires are like, and on and on. I came across a few discussions over what would happen in this book, which I tried to avoid, but people were coming up with all sorts of things: about babies, about what Bella's special gift would be, about the wedding and so on.I would have thought that this book would have completely satisfied people, but from the glimpses I've caught (much to my annoyance), a lot of fans seem almost scornful of how things panned out. Maybe it's because there was too much of a build-up, like with the last Harry Potter book, and it creates an anti-climax. I'd like to pat myself on the back for avoiding that feeling, by steering clear of all the online discussions - though it's hard on Goodreads, because people's comments pop up on your updates page. Grrr.The pregnancy took me by surprise, but I loved it. It was plausible, it was scary, and by switching Point-of-View to Jacob in the middle there (an ingenious device), we not only get a more fleshed-out perspective of that period, a wise move, but it makes Bella's life more fragile, precarious, uncertain. For a while there I was extremely worried that she wouldn't survive. Edward's pain was so very real, and really got to me.The baby device is quite common in fantasy - the baby that will save the world or the baby that will unite people and so on. Here it was much more personal though, and I appreciated that. Renesmee was a little too perfect, but her bizarre nature balanced it enough that she wasn't too sickly sweet. I wasn't surprised at Jacob imprinting with her - and it was certainly an effective way of handling that pesky problem! I wonder, though, was Bella less interesting when she no longer had to worry herself over two men?As for the other characters, apart from Bella and Jacob, they're very much in the background, which was rather disappointing. Playing their typical support roles, it felt a little rushed at times, almost like Meyer's heart wasn't really in it - as I understand it she wrote this book because her publisher wanted her to, like with the previous two; Twilight was meant to be a stand-alone novel in the beginning. [I've since learnt from a friend who saw her interviewed that she had this planned out from the beginning and had to convince her publishers to let her do it in four books. But it still felt a bit rushed and half-hearted in places.]Is it just me or is Jacob Meyer's favourite? He gets an awful lot of airtime here, which gives us a chance to feel really comfortable with him, and he has a nice irreverent tone, but it still leaves many of the other characters thinly sketched. Even Edward, I never really feel like we break through his mystery and outward charisma to the person beneath. Bella sees him as a kind of idol, and as such, he's almost inhuman (ha ha). His emotions come across, but not so much his reasoning, or motivations. I'm not sure, maybe that's not it exactly, but I always want more Edward and want I'm given just doesn't satisfy me.Now, it was always going to be tricky, writing Bella as a vampire. All her main quirks as a human are gone - the clumsiness, the blushing, the sweetness - which Meyer always used to define her character, so I was really pleased at how she managed to make Bella a convincing vampire while still retaining enough to make her familiar. Her voice doesn't really change, but her actions have. She's much less vulnerable, and that's bound to change anyone. But her body language has been altered, and her confidence too. It worked well. Edward, too, no longer treated her like a fragile human but effortlessly shifted his perspective and treated her as more of a partner, less as an eccentric pet.The climax was less climactic than the other books, but the fact that it didn't end on violence like the previous book gave the end of the series the right kind of ending, a peaceful one. Bella's special ability made sense, and while it's not visibly impressive, it's certainly very useful and fits her character: always trying to protect others.Is it just me or do all the books start with Bella in a car? I can't remember how the others started and I didn't get a chance to have a look, but it seemed like they do. If they do, it's an interesting comfort zone.I love Meyer's version of the vampiric species - it's original and very well fleshed out, and differs at important points from the more generic, Anne Rice version, making them much more attractive, less vulnerable creatures. This is an addictive series, with as many detractors as fans, and with as much hoo-ha as Harry Potter. They're not as well written as the Harry Potter books, but they're nothing to cringe over either - you don't read them for the prose, but for the story, which is emotionally intense and very, very addictive. It's a classic love story, it's just that the circumstances are a little different.So, I guess the long and the short of it is, I loved the book, yet it wasn't wholly satisfying, like there was something missing, some part of character development maybe, or maybe I'm just wishing Edward was more fleshed out, now that Bella's like him and he's no longer an alien species. I can't quite put my finger on it. But there were lots of surprises, and the plot was well-structured in three parts, three distinct stages, with all the emotional gut-punching I've come to expect from Meyer. Truly, she puts me through the wringer like Diana Gabaldon - and for this alone I will always love these books (yes, I like the feeling of being put through the proverbial emotional wringer!). It's also a great romance, though too much time was spent telling us of the bond between Bella and Edward, and not enough time showing us. Perhaps that was what bugged me?"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/893680-lauren", "userReview": "I gave Breaking Dawn several days' worth of chances and it did nothing but stun, anger, and disappoint me. I enjoyed the first three books, despite how badly written and full of grammar mistakes and typos they were, because they were fun and exciting and took me away from a sucky year at college. Breaking Dawn, however, was so shockingly awful that I actually burst into hysterical laughter every time something drastic happened. I actually was unable to read it in one sitting like I wanted to because my brain couldn't handle the ridiculousness for more than an hour at a time. Not even considering how insanely bad the plot and writing were, the morals the book presents made me wonder how Stephenie even managed to get it published. Moral #1: Marriage is easy. Bella doesn't have to pay for, take care of, or do anything in the way of keeping her marriage going. Not even touching on the whole Mr. Perfect issue. Moral #2: The only thing worth staying alive for is sex. Bella never stopped considering her choice to become a vampire until she had sex with Edward and then suddenly wanted to hold back. Crying and begging him to screw her because her happy dream was over? Come on girl, have some pride. Pull yourself together, Bella. Sex isn't everything. Moral #3: Women are only good for babymaking. \"Had her body changed because she was a werewolf? Or had she become a werewolf because her body was wrong? The only female werewolf in the history of forever. Was that because she wasn't as female as she should be?\" Are infertile females less female because they can't make babies and that's all women are good for? Stephenie thinks so. Moral #4: All of your problems will be solved for you, so don't try to fix them. That year of wanting to drink human blood? Don't worry about it, you'll just skip it anyway. That baby who's killing you from the inside? Don't sweat it, Edward will just make you a vampire and then you'll be fine. Annoying cub boy won't fall out of love with you? Chill out, he'll imprint on your babies and then you won't ever have to worry about them getting in the way of your perfect love life again. And that leads into #5...Moral #5: Pedophilia is okay! Just wait until they get old enough (or in Renesmee's case, wait until they're 6 years old because then they'll look old enough) and you're good to go. I could keep going with the morals but I feel the need to touch on the fact that the ending was the biggest and most awful cop-out I could've imagined her writing. The other books had incredibly kickass, awesome action scenes that pulled me in and wouldn't let me stop reading. Breaking Dawn just built up and built up and then the Volturi just decided, whatever, no battle. Go home with your mutant baby. See you in six years when she tries to make babies with the werewolf and we get pissed off at you again. There were no struggles. There were a lot of solutions springing from midair and the preparation for sacrifices that were never made. And that is why Breaking Dawn ruined the Twilight series for me."}, {"userName": "Denys L.H.", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/711091-denys-l-h", "userReview": "The last book of the series. You would think this would all get better, eh? It hasn't for the most part. But yeah, there is a happy ending (no doubt about it). Yeah, they DO IT (Bitchface and Edtard). Yeah, Bella turns into a vampire. How come I'm not surprised? The novel ended all too neat and too predictable. But in the middle of the book, there was a whole load of unfortunate and turning events going on. And no, I didn't see THAT one coming...In the beginning of the book, Bella is bitching (of course) about this really awesome car Edward brought for her that many people are asking about (good way to start, amirite?). She and the Cullens are planning the big wedding day, and she's also bitching about that. She just wants everything to get over with it so she can DO IT with her beloved vampire 'lover.' However, she hasn't told her father or her mother that she's getting married yet. When she finally does, she tells her father first (with Edward along her side). His reaction was just unbelievable. He wasn't comfortable with the idea, but he accepted it. WHAT!? YOUR DAUGHTER'S MARRYING SOME SPARKLY BOY THAT SHE'S ONLY KNOWN FOR A YEAR. SHE ONLY WANTS TO DO IT WITH HIM BADLY. The once, strict Charlie that wasn't too crazy about Edward has vanished into thin air. And then Bella tells her mother she's getting married. Her mother assumes that it's right for Bella because she's always making \"good\" choices for herself. If only you knew, Renee. If only you knew.So then, we speed things up to the wedding. I admit, I was dazzled when I was reading it, but it's only because I ignored the fact it was Bella and Edward's and made them change positions with my boyfriend and I (silly, I know). The wedding starts to get more interesting when Jacob comes (yaaay). He dances with Bella and she casually tells him she will be having a honeymoon. Jacob worries about Bella, because she might get killed by Edward when they're DOING IT. Alas, she doesn't listen. Edward the meanie had to escort Jacob away. >( All in all, I had only one complaint for this. The wedding was written very short.Next, we go to the honeymoon. Finally, Bella can fulfill her wishes and have dreamy sex with her new husband. But that's all she cares about though. That's the reason why she's even married to him, just to have her lustful, selfish ways with him. Edward refuses to have sex with her at first, since he thinks he'll hurt her, but Bella the sex-obsessed puppy doesn't care. She acts like a friggin' horn dog for crying out loud. They finally do it, but we never get the details on it (sorry for all you erotica fans out there). In the morning, Bella's awoken with bruises everywhere courtesy of Edward. He even ate a pillow because the sex was so immense. LOL.Bella wants to do it again (hormonal, much?), but Edward does not. Bella practically cries and begs to have Edward make rough love to her. D; They do it again. This time, Edward breaks the bed. And an amount of days later, Bella starts vomiting and getting her period late. She also has a big bump on her stomach. This probably means she has cancer, or Edward has super mutant sperm after all those years of being a virgin.Bella is pregnant. Their honeymoon is over. They go back to the Cullens to get an abortion, but Bella doesn't want one. Edward thinks the little freak inside her will kill her, since it's half vampire. Bella doesn't want to hear the fact that her little precious bundle of a monster might be \"killed.\" It's giving a secret pro-life message, I tell ya! I thought vampires weren't suppose to have babies though. Stephenie Meyer has even broken her own rules in order to make this all go happy. We got into Jacob's point-of-view now. His point-of-view isn't so great, infact, it's superlame. He talks to other werewolves telepathically and that gets very annoying after awhile. He gets news about Bella being killer pregnant and then he hurriedly comes by her side. We could see Bella isn't looking so good and that the little 'nudger' is doing more damage to her. Edward tells Jacob to try to convince Bella to get rid of it and have another baby, but this time, with Jacob. First of all, WHAT ARE YOU DOING EDWARD!? Shouldn't you be talking to this with Bella first, to see if she'll be okay with the idea!? AND JACOB, why are you agreeing to this!? I know Edward wants to protect her, but c'mon! Let Jacob move on already! He doesn't need this.Of course, Bella doesn't agree to this. She clearly states to Jacob that she rather have Edward's baby, than some \"stranger's\" (he didn't clarify). So then, Bella's bones get broken by this baby. Y'know, at this point, I'm getting tired of everything revolving around Bella. It's making me feel sick just listening to everyone tend to that ungrateful, unappreciative broad. She's not a heroine, and never was. She's just a retard who can't make proper decisions for being an 18 year old.So then more stuff happens about Jacob that really doesn't matter. And then Bella gives violent birth to a baby girl that she named \"Renesmee\" (how do you even pronounce that!?). Seriously, the birth scene was so disgusting to read about. She drinks blood for her baby, and she enjoyed it. BLEEEEEEH. Bella is then dying, but Edward finally turns her into a sexy vampire. They take Nessie (Jacob's nickname for Renesmee) away because they're afraid Bella might hurt her, since Nessie's half-human. But Bella's aware of this, so she doesn't have those side effects that newcomer vampires have when they're newcomers. Mary-Sue FOREVA. Those two don't even have a mother/daughter bond! They're not that into each other. Jacob and Rosalie are more caring of Nessie than Bella is. And what's worse is that Jacob IMPRINTED on Nessie. WHAT THE FUCK, JACOB!? That screams out pedophile. I don't care what the fangirls say. It's pedophilia.We go back to Bella's point-of-view. More shit happens, like her first hunt, she has lame-ass powers, she does it with Edward again, and Nessie fully physically matures after 6 days. Again, what the fuck!? Bella loved it even more when she did it with Edward as a vampire. If you could've done and loved it more when you're a vampire, WHY DIDN'T YOU BEFORE TURN INTO ONE BEFORE!? I don't really care about the events going on with the Voultri because they're very unimportant. I just skipped towards the ending. And, oh yes, there's a happy ending. They continued peacefully into their small, but \"perfect\" piece of whatever.The whole novel sucks. My love for Jacob totally went down 100 points, Nessie was just a plot device, and Bella and Edward live on forever. EVERYONE'S FUCKING HAPPY. I don't get why some twi-hard fans are in love with this book! They're only preoccupied with the happy ending! It went from a high-school romance,into a bloody-love fest. This whole Twilight series officially sucks ass. This was all to expected, and all too obvious.

A baby?A(nother) pedophil-esque imprint?THIS IS WHAT WE WAITED FOR??ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? THIS WASN'T AN EPIC NOVEL, IT WAS A CONTAGIOUS RASH.Everything we came to know (and presumably love) about the characters and the way their stories were told in the first three books completely sh*t the bed in this one. It was impossible to bond with any of the characters in the book, especially Edward, who became no more than a peripheral sperm donor.Each plot development/\"twist\" was either so ridiclulous I wanted to scream, or so predictable that I had to groan. For this I rented a hotel room and stayed-up all night?Oh, and BREAKING DAWN the MAJOR MOTION PICTURE......I just can't wait to see that gruesome Anne-Rice-Mayfair-Witch-Style-DIY-Cesaerean-Section brought to life on the big screen!!Nah, how about a colonoscopy instead?FOLLOW-UP:Now that I've had a few days to calm down from my violent objections, I am ready to explain in detail why, I feel, this book sucked. In plot order:1) The wedding was pretty good, but it was the only time we saw Angela, Mike, Jessica and Ben in the entire book. What happened? SM just kind of abandoned them. And Renee fell off the face of the earth, too. And I think that Bella's nearly non-existent reaction to meeting Tanya was out of character for her. The Bella we all know would have stressed it alot more.2) The \"sex\" scene(s) irked me on so many levels. First of all, how does a vampire with no blood flowing through his body acheive an erection? I preferred SM's method of politely skirting the subject in the first three books to her method of making the subject increasingly more annoying and prevalent throughout BD. Emmett's comments and innuendos became almost as annoying as Bella's out of control libido. She can resist the bloodlust but not the sex lust...Is she a vampire or a porn star?3) The pregnancy sent me over the edge. How does a vampire with no seminal fluids impregnate a woman? Bella's 2-month transition from high school senior to wife and mother was too difficult to swallow....and I was a young wife and mother myself.4) Rosalie. We already hated her and making her into a Nazi midwife didn't help.5)The birth. OMFG WHAT WAS THAT???? If I had read that before I had kids I would have scheduled myself for a tubal ligation the next day.6) The name Renesme is so awful that everytime I looked at it (6 million times over) I choked on it. She couldn't have just used Carlie? It might have helped us bond with the beastly little mutant.7) Where did our Edward go? The object of 60 million readers' desires turned into a sulking and helpless sperm donor. THAT'S NOT SEXY.8) Jacob had to be a pedophile? Even as a strong Team Edward supporter, I always loved Jacob just for being goofy and sweet and sincere (mostly) and all the good things about a 16 year old boy. Better off alone or with Leah than with (essentially) his ex-girlfriend's daugher. YUCK.8) Bella's transition from super klutz to super hero was too much. Throwing the shield across the field to defeat Jane and Alec, the two biggest badasses in Italy? Oh, c'mon.9) The battle with the Volturi was no battle at all. All of those vampires and wolves in one place and all they could do was kill Irina? The story was too long and I don't think SM gave the characters their proper attention. It read SO much differently than the first three. We didn't have enough quality time with our old favorites...not enough of Alice after the wedding and definitely not enough sexy Edward.She spent alot of time on the baby, but I found myself completely unable to bond with her....maybe because even Bella spent more time worrying about sex than she did about the baby.

It's taken Snark Squad over a year to read and recap this book, in large part because it was actively awful. Listen, this isn't hating on a popular series because it's cheesy or a love story or any of that other nonsense. This is an actual garbage story. First, it's PROBLEMATIC, which is consistent from the previous entries. Bella and Edward \"can't\" have sex while she's a human, because if they have sex, Bella will probably actually die. For the entire series, Bella's sexuality is held hostage to Edward's rules and whims. Then, they finally get married, and instead of backing up her IF YOU HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE YOU WILL DIE BUT SEX AFTER MARRIAGE IS COOL message, Stephenie Meyer just makes sex horrible period? Bella isn\u2019t allowed to enjoy sex. She can\u2019t bring herself to talk about sex with her partner in a mature or adult way. Edward lords sex over her as a means of control. When she finally \"gets to\" have sex, it's physically dangerous for her. After she has sex, she has to repeatedly apologize for it. Bella enjoys sex, but she's \"too fragile\" to have it. Bella has to beg, plead and scheme her way into more sex. Bella gets insta-pregnant and it kills her. WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS MESSAGING? Breaking Dawn is also racist in a lot of little, strange, micro-aggressive ways. And then it's racist in very overt ways. Stephenie Meyer made the Native Americans in her story werewolves, and then spends the entire series calling them feral, wild, dogs, smelly and assuring us they are the lesser supernatural race. Then, in this book, we get vampires from all over the world, and all of the people of color are wild or described in the most painful and stereotypical ways. And then, in the worst turn of events ever, Jacob  imprints on A BABY. And if anyone tells you \"it isn't like that,\" question their reading comprehension, because it is LIKE THAT AS HELL. At BEST, it is child grooming. At worst, we have to read about a pedophile over and over again. \"But they are supernatural beings who don't follow our rules.\" Like, okay people. If that's what you need to tell yourself to feel good about reading a man fall in love with a days old baby. I, for one, hated it. It's gross, especially because it's meant to be this epic love. Imprinting as a concept is messed up because it robs agency from especially the women in the equation. It's extra gross when that woman is actually A BABY. You guys, it's implied that the entire reason Jacob even liked Bella was because of a pull toward HER UNFERTILIZED EGG? LIKE W H A T T H E H E L L. But okay. Let's say you don't care about all the awful messaging in this book, from misogyny to pedophiles, and racism in between. This also is not a good story? It's nearly 800 pages of NEXT TO NOTHING HAPPENING. 800 pages and we rush past the marriage (the ceremony is skipped over), get a chapter of honeymoon, then she's pregnant and we get the pregnancy and delivery FROM TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WHY, and then the Volturi take MONTHS to get to Fork and I swear to god, at one point the vampires spend an entire night staring at each other. I'M NOT JOKING. In the last 30ish pages, we get the big \"showdown,\" but after gathering all of these incredibly powerful vampires, the big showdown is a bunch of people talking in a field for 4 chapters. And then that's it. And then it's over.AFTER 800 PAGES. It was boring, plot-less, repetitive, Bella consistently cheats her way through narration, knowing things she couldn't possibly know. Meyer plays fast and loose with her own vampire rules. Bella is immediately the best at everything, so there is absolutely no tension there.

I lent Twilight to Cate-across-the-road; we gave her New Moon as a present, and she lent it back to me; most recently, she bought Eclipse, and I borrowed it after she finished. I suggested to her father that the logical next step would be for me to sneak in through her bedroom window and steal Breaking Dawn. I'm not entirely sure he found this funny.____________________________________________I am shocked, dismayed, not surprised at all to discover from Usually Reliable Sources that the series has a happy ending. Let's recap. The story so far: Bella, a shy, bookish, unimaginative 17 year old girl who's never been kissed, falls in love with Edward, who once was human but has now been transformed, by means not fully explained in the books, into a robot-like being with an insatiable craving for blood. Edward tries to control every aspect of Bella's life, including stealing into her bedroom at night and watching over her while she sleeps. At one point, Edward leaves Bella abruptly, pushing her into a state of suicidal despair. He in fact believes, on rather slender evidence, that she has killed herself, and, rather than trying to find out whether she really is dead, decides to kill himself too. Bella, who has not died, is forced to risk her life a second time to save his.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"}, {"userName": "Katrina Passick Lumsden", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden", "userReview": "Twilight was bad. Not offensively bad, but where Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse failed, Breaking Dawn succeeded. It managed to piss me off, make me laugh, and offend me.What's wrong with Breaking Dawn? Oh, where do I start? Let's see, inconsistent, dense characters, nauseatingly corny passages, enough plot holes to march a large army through, and a climactic ending that is anything but climactic. The ending did surprise me, but only because I never thought it was possible to write such a terribly pointless story. The beginning of the book is a continuation of the end of Eclipse, with Bella preparing for hers and Edward's wedding. Just how we came to the two of them getting married is bad enough; she wants to have sex with Edward and be turned into a vampire. Edward won't turn her into a vampire until she's his wife, and they both want to wait until after they're married to have sex. Why on earth morals and ethics are playing any part in this story whatsoever is beyond me. Edward claims that, while he believes he's going to hell just for being a vampire, he doesn't want to risk everything by destroying his one last virtue in the hell-fires of premarital sex. He also doesn't want to compromise Bella's virtue. *Cough*. 'Cause, you know, having sex with a creature your religion would consider an abomination is OK, just as long as you're married to it first.Does Bella want to marry Edward? Nope. She's only doing so because of the aforementioned sex and vampirism. But her reasons for being reluctant to marry are just as ridiculous as her reasons for going through with it; she's afraid of what her family and friends will think of her and Edward getting married at the tender ages of 18. OK, so willingly turning into a vampire and disappearing forever is all right, but heaven forbid someone whispers that you're too young to get married? If you're removing yourself from human society, what the hell does it matter? The honeymoon is just fraught with peril as Edward attempts to have sex with Bella without completely cutting loose and crushing her skull in a passionate rage. If I had a dime for every time....Bella gets pregnant and we spend the whole middle third of the book hearing about her condition through the eyes of Jacob the Wolfboy, Bella's best friend who is in love with her. The pregnancy is killing her, but she refuses to do anything but carry it to term (just a hint of anti-abortion sentiment there, huh?). It takes Jacob the Wolfboy to figure out that the baby needs blood to thrive in the womb....an entire family of vampires (one of whom is a 400 year old doctor) couldn't figure out that a baby fathered by a vampire would need blood? She has the baby, a daughter, that she names Renesmee (a hybrid of the names Renee and Esme...stupid fucking name). Renesmee is, of course, perfect. After nearly dying in childbirth, Edward turns Bella. Something I can't quite figure out is why he uses a giant steel syringe to inject his venom directly into Bella's heart...and *then* gives her small bites everywhere. One bite is enough to turn someone, so...Bella supposedly hates lying. Meyer drills this into our heads several times throughout the first three books. She hates lying, she's not any good at it, it makes her uncomfortable, etc. Not to mention the many times Bella became angry with Edward for not telling her the whole truth (his misguided attempt at protecting her from anything unpleasant). You would think that someone who dislikes being kept in the dark by the man she loves would go to great lengths to ensure she never does the same to him. You would think that, but apparently you would be wrong. The process of transformation from mortal to immortal is supposed to be exceedingly painful, stretching out over a period of two to three days. While everyone else who's undergone the transformation has writhed in pain for the duration, screaming for days on end, brave little Bella manages to keep herself completely under control. She never moves, never opens her eyes, never speaks, for fear that if she does, the screaming will commence. Then, when the transformation is complete and her pain is gone, what is her very first act as the newly immortal member of clan Cullen? She lies to them. Yes, she lies. She can't bear the thought of Edward feeling badly...feeling personally responsible for her days of intense agony. So she does the exact same thing that she previously, on many occasions, chastised him for. She pretends the transformation was a cake-walk, that she doesn't remember anything about it...thanks to Edward's brilliant idea of loading her up with morphine before injecting her with vamp juice. Apparently, Bella is much more special than anyone could ever imagine. While everyone else goes through their \"newborn\" phase of vampirism, spending a good year consumed by blood thirst and uncontrollable, unpredictable PMS-type mood swings, Bella is capable of skipping right over *that* unpleasantness. She comes very close to running down humans in the woods to feast on their flesh, but her concentration is broken by Edward and she's able to hold her breath and run away before killing anyone. Edward is just awe-struck by her self control. (By this point, I was wondering how long it would be before the rest of the vampires donned togas, placed a crown on Bella's head, and began bowing at her feet.)The characters are completely different. One expects characters to change over the course of a single story, much less a series of stories, but generally those changes are progressive. They mature and they change, for better or worse. These characters, on the other hand, are just different. The Edward from Twilight is completely absent in Breaking Dawn. Gone is the willful, wise, protective, stoic, quiet, bossy Edward. He's been replaced by his pussy-whipped, Bella-worshiping doormat of a twin. Bella herself has become even *more* selfish than we've ever seen her. The other characters are nothing more than peripheral. Meyer could have done a lot with the characters she introduced in the first book, but she failed spectacularly. There's a slew of new characters introduced in Breaking Dawn, none of whom were capitalized on the way they *could* have been. One of the major plot points in the first book is the Cullen clan's need to move around frequently. Every three or four years, the family moves before the people in the area become suspicious of their non-aging. But at the end of Breaking Dawn, no one seems even slightly interested in leaving Forks. Renesmee will end up with Jacob the Wolfboy, and Bella is perfectly happy that her father knows just enough about her \"situation\" to be able to visit and not be in danger of knowing their deepest, darkest secret. On the other hand, Bella laments that her mother doesn't need to know anything since she's \"too fragile\" to have any hint that her daughter's changed. I still have no idea what on earth they plan on doing if Bella's mother drops in for a surprise visit once she finds out from her ex-husband that they have a granddaughter...that her own daughter never bothered to tell her about.We eventually find out that Bella is referred to as \"a shield\" which is why Edward can't read her mind the way he can other peoples. She's trained to project her shield to protect others from psychic attacks by other vampires. Then there's the *thrilling* ending in which the Cullens and their various vampire friends unite against the Volturi. But there's no battle. After page after page of build-up, absolutely *nothing* happens. Bella, in a fit of intense rage, is able to project her shield to everyone in her group, and the Volturi, without any evidence of any law being broken, give up and leave. The end of the book is so nauseatingly happy it's amazing I was able to keep my gag reflux under control. Edward and Bella are together and they have their little girl child (who, conveniently, will be fully mature at the age of 7 years, then stop aging and be immortal). Oh, Renesmee is also the new object of Jacob the Wolfboy's affection (apparently, shapeshifters/werewolves \"imprint\" to find mates and Renesmee just happens to be the lucky imprintee). So after spending 3 1/2 books pining over Bella, Jacob's affection is rapidly shifted to her daughter. *That* was quick and easy clean up. Constant Bella worship, smarmy \"gag me with a spoon\" Hallmark moments, easy-outs in regards to tying up lose plot ends so everyone can be happy, an overuse of cliche's, and a complete deviation from character personalities. What do all of these things indicate? A book which was written for the express purpose of making more money. It's glaringly obvious. I could overlook it if it were a stand-alone story, but Meyer did a great disservice to her readers by sucking them into a story that started out fairly tolerable, then ending it with this crap.I \"shuddered\" and \"grimaced\" through the entire thing."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "You read the first 200 pages & tell yourself: Cronenberg could be proud. Am I witnessing the biggest twist in literature history? This was the equivalent of Frodo Baggins losing the ring or Hannibal Lecter coming out of the closet! The book begins in foreign, even (gasp!) exciting territory... something so outlandish... in the right hands it just might have worked. Or at least redeemed the three prior mediocre novels. Meyer does neither.This belonging in the long, half-assed written series soon fizzles after the first of two or three total anticlimaxes. Two words describes what follows: Freak Show. And not the cool Tod Browning freaks we are accustomed to (\"We Accept You! We Accept You! One of Us!\"), or the psycho family in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. These freaks are here to keep the family values intact, to uphold the freaky status quo. These are the lamest cardboard characters ever! Obviously someone asked to shell out tens of dollars for one of the firstly printed hardcover editions will not be respected: Meyer has fooled everyone... the series is a long and sad disappointment. I can finally put that to rest; the \"Twilight\" series, at least for me, will now become a gauge to check somebody's true literary intellect! Meyer dedicates this steaming pile to her audience: a buncha teen girls hungry for some literary gum for their developing brains to chew on, with \"good taste.\" What a joke. If I were the band Muse (one I too am a fan of) & Meyer dedicated her book to us, I would seriously fire my managers & take forever to get over the existentialist rut her endorsement would've undoubtedly inspired."}, {"userName": "Syl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393019-syl", "userReview": "I'd like to start out this review with three simple words that pretty much give away my feelings for this particular story (for those of you who have no desire to read my rant).I hated it.My friend --who stayed up reading the night it came out -- called me very early the morning of the 2nd and told me quite a bit of the plot. I was horrified. I wasn't even going to read it until she threatened to gouge out my eyes with a plastic spork. Quite honestly, I'm starting to wish I'd agreed to the spork idea. I haven't even been able to finish reading it (not in the 'I'm-a-slow-reader' sort of way either... more in the 'I-have-to-take-a-break-every-few-pages-to-retain-my-sanity' kind of way)I wont even go into the whole awful message stuff -- and there are quite a few awful messages. Truthfully, I'd be totally happy to overlook all the imprinting shit along with the married and pregnant at 18, the way Bella can't survive without a boyfriend (be it Edward or Jacob), or... well never-mind, you get the point. I'd overlook it, if the plot had been good. Quite frankly, calling all the nonsense in that book plot would be pushing it a little bit. Now, I have no problem with Mrs. Meyer's writing style -- in fact, I think she's a very good writer. She has the potential of writing a great book if only she put more thought into her plot. I was kind of hoping that there'd be some big, dramatic plot tie-up -- like Harry Potter. JK Rowling had obviously thought about her plot -- in fact, the plot of all the stories came together for the ending. It was brilliant. That was obviously not the case here. I felt almost like I was reading a bunch of half-hearted fan-fiction -- 600-plus pages at a time. None of the four books had much to do with each-other, save for the characters (scratch that, the characters might as well have been different people for all I recognized them in the end), and Bella's wish to have sex with Edward and then be turned into a vampire. I mean no offense to fan-fiction. I read this book with very little expectation because I didn't much like the 2nd, or the 3rd installment of the series. Somehow, I still managed to be very disappointed. I can't even begin to imagine the utter horror of someone who'd actually expected it to be good.Another one of my huge complaints: the Characterization. Where oh where did it go? We were getting some in the first book -- as in the character's actually seemed a bit like real people -- but it slowly began disappearing. You can't even relate to Bella because she's so... irritating/whiny/clingy/dependent/indecisive/totally unreal. Pick a word -- they all work.My main complaint: the Short Cut -- and by that of course, I mean the baby. Because, admit it! The baby was just a way to wrap up the series and tie it with a pretty, red bow. Jacob gets his girlfriend (never-mind the fact that she's Bella's daughter and less then a year old), and Edward gets to turn Bella into a vampire, guilt-free. I can't even begin to express my unhappiness for this particular plot development. I was shocked when I found out Bella was pregnant -- though, it was more of a 'Please shoot me now and spare me' kind of shocked. I honestly thought (hoped) that it wouldn't happen because it was so unrealistic. Hell, she didn't even try very hard to make it seem plausible. ::cries:: I wanted to see Bella freak out -- because come on! She's 18, just married, and has never expressed any desire to have children of any sort (much less mutated half vampire children). Add in the fact that the baby was totally unplanned and is slowly killing her... But nope, no biggie -- her heart just \"swells to twice it's normal size\" -- and here I'd hoped that that was the start of a heart attack or something.Mrs. Meyer's totally screwed over her own rules -- from start she'd made it quite clear that vampires could NOT have children. Now, while I am aware that Bella isn't a vampire so ok, sure, it's possible that could work... she could have done way better. Couldn't they have introduced the possibility sooner? Like Charlisle could have brought it up? Or Edward could have worried about it? Then it would have seemed more realistic. The two sentences it used to explain the pregnancy revealed it as the desperate short-cut it was. Also, I just have to say... Bella would NOT make a good mother. This is the girl who jumped off a bloody cliff just to hear her boyfriend's voice. Honestly, she should probably work on protecting that poor baby from herself. Perhaps it's lucky that Jacob imprinted on it? Maybe together they can work on not dropping it on it's head? The name also needs to be mentioned (though I promise it will be briefly). Why would they name their daughter after the Loch Ness Monster? If it knew, I'm sure the poor thing would be insulted (the monster, not the kid).I totally see the attraction of this series, it represents every teenager's dream romance -- I really wanted to like it, but Mrs. Meyer made it a bit difficult for me.. Every book became steadily worse -- and every single fan-fiction mistake can be found on the pages of this series, horribly enough. You know the author doesn't know their character well enough when the readers begin to complain about them being out of character. I hate to rain on the parade and all that, but I really did dislike the book. It was slow and boring and the (very small) plot-line was much too drawn out for it to be anything but a painful read.Promising... but very disappointing."}, {"userName": "Ramona", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33526516-ramona", "userReview": "The first book from this series comes with a great and unique story line that will leave you hanging until the last pages, but believe me, the torture will be worth it.I am a big fan of the series and of the movies, but the books always had a special place in my heart because it is impossible to capture all the details of the plot in just 2 hours of shooting.So, because of this, the book rock and give you a complete image of the Twilight universe.In Breaking Dawn, we have the great moment we all have been waiting for: Bella and Edward's wedding!! Yes :D It was amazing and simple, exactly like they want it. I enjoyed how down to Earth his moment was, and not with some fairytale ideas and complicated elements. It was purely about 2 people that love each other and want to spend FOREVER together. And from my point of view, that was the only human element in the book, because after their honeymoon things will happen and will completely change our heroes relationship.I'm not a fan of spoilers, so you will have to read it in order to understand exactly what I'm saying, and without seeing the movie first. Please:)I enjoyed that Stephenie Meyer took our heroes relationship to another level. We get to see them more intimate, more involved in romantic moments and it was delightful. I've waited so much for this to happened, and it didn't disappoint. Besides providing high quality love, the writer provided an original plot, with a lot of tensioned moments and suspense. The connection that were made really impressed me and I have to say that the last 30% of the book was captivating. With a very sad heart I had to say goodbye to my beloved characters and just enjoy the wonderful moments that they shared with me. I believe Stephenie did a great job in closing this series, without leaving things hanging or giving away the impression of clich\u00e9. It had the perfect amount of fiction in it, blended with reality and genuine feelings.I will miss Bella and Edward terribly.4 stars!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369865-elizabeth", "userReview": "I'm going to say right off the bat that this review contains spoilers.Spoilers ahoy.I'm not even sure where to start. Should I start with the contrived pregnancy? Should I start with the ridiculous name \"Renesmee\"? Should I start with Jacob imprinting on the vampire hybrid infant/toddler/whatever of the woman he loves? Or should I go right to the only really good part of the book, which was meeting all the different vampire clans, covens, and nomads, in preparation for a confrontation with the Volturi, only to have it build up to exactly nothing?Stephenie Meyers has betrayed her readers on a scale that I have only ever seen from Laurell K. Hamilton. A series about choice and sacrifice has as its final volume an elaborate piece fanfiction that includes every cliche you can think of, in order to tie up everyone's stories with a neat little bow. Now, I am a married woman with a child, but I certainly don't think that's something to hold up to teen girls as something they should have done by age 18. I was never thrilled with the marriage plot, although considering Meyers' background I could have lived with it, but I found the pregnancy plot ridiculous, and worse, a cop-out. Meyers could have created the same conflict with the Volturi by having Bella decided she wanted a few more years of humanity- as she almost does decide, before the pregnancy angle comes into play. She could have resolved Jacob's story by having him fall for Leah- which would have tied up that poor girl's loose ends, too. She even still could have included Bella's change as a method to placate the Volturi, only to be too little, too late. Unfortunately, instead the author seemed to decided to take the most outlandish ideas she could come up with and run with them.The good: reading the middle section from Jacob's POV. It was refreshing to have a realistic teenage voice and realistic teenage reactions to things. I also appreciated the plot involving the wolf pack, especially Leah and Seth. Unfortunately, this was mitigated by having Jacob's section focus almost entirely on Bella and the pregnancy, and ended with the most horrific delivery scene I've ever read and Jacob's imprinting on baby Nessie (no joke about the nickname, sadly). Another good aspect of the book I already mentioned, which was seeing all the various vampires from around the world, and reading about their interactions. Unfortunately, they came in to prepare for the most anticlimactic scene yet in this series.Overall, I would categorize myself as horribly disappointed. I'm still shocked that what I just read was the real book and the true conclusion to Edward, Bella, and Jacob's stories.

When Bella faces unexpected and life-threatening situations, she willingly risks her human life and possible vampire immortality.\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627: \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u061b \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u06cc\u0631\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0634\u0634\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u06cc\u0631\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0647\u0645\u0646\u060c \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1388\u061b \u062f\u0631 725 \u0635\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1389\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789641741190\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645\u060c \u06a9\u0631\u062c\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0647\u0645\u0646\u060c 1389\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0633\u062f\u0647 21 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u06cc\u0631\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u062c\u06cc\u062f \u0646\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0686\u06a9\u0627\u0648\u06a9\u060c \u067e\u06af\u0627\u0647\u060c 1393\u061b \u062f\u0631 700 \u0635\u061b 89\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789648957204\u061b \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u00ab\u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0645\u00bb \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u06af\u0641\u062a \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u00ab\u0634\u0641\u0642\u00bb \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u00ab\u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u00bb \u0648 \u00ab\u062e\u0633\u0648\u0641\u00bb \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u00ab\u0628\u0644\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0646\u00bb \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0632 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u06af\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0633\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u060c \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u06cc\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0621 \u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0627\u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u062f\u062f. \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37088-holly", "userReview": "Half a star--because I at least managed to finish it.Things I learned from reading the Twilight series:1. Stalker boyfriends are supposed to be sexy. Particularly if they are suffocatingly obsessive as well.2. True perfection is becoming EXACTLY like your boyfriend and his family.3. The consequences of sex include having a baby. The consequences of having a baby might include having your spine broken and your womb shredded by vampire teeth.4. If you choose to sacrifice everything to become like your boyfriend, so that you are no longer recognizable as yourself, it's okay, because all of your friends and family will totally support that.5. Stephenie Meyer freaks me out. 6. Renesmee is possibly the stupidest name in non-existence, but that's okay because it was picked by a teenager. Also I imagine that there will be a crop of Renesmees being born in the next few years and I pity them.7. I'm too old for this shit.Also, the ending was absolute crap. I spend ages waiting for a good old fashioned bloodletting, with finally the decently evil vampires all set to fight, and then they just all slink away like a bunch of hippies who accidentally crashed a Hells Angels meeting?Eff dat."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733635-heather", "userReview": "***DEFINITELY contains SPOILERS***Sorry so long, but I had a lot to say about the end of one of my favorite series.This is a hard one. Overall, I got what I wanted \u2013 The wedding, Bella\u2019s change, Jacob imprinting, and minimal loss of life. It was the perfect fairy tale ending with a \u2018happily ever after\u2019. So I should be happy, right? To begin with, I think the book was too crowded and rushed. It could have easily been 2 books, giving us so much more in every aspect. Everything was too neatly taken apart and put back together, and I really think SM could have been more creative with that if she had more time and space for it. It just seemed a little surreal and disjointed. If she had some of these things planned all along, she really should have prepared her readers a little better. Honestly, this book didn\u2019t feel like her writing; in fact, it felt a little shallow. However, there were a lot of surprises and twists, and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a few of the chapters, which is one reason I won't say it was bad. Bella & Edward \u2013 Not enough romance\u2026at least not once the honeymoon was over. Their relationship is my favorite part of the series and it just went forgotten in this book. Part of the reason I read this series is because of the \u2018feeling\u2019 I get when I do (you know what I mean), and that was lost after the first 200 pages or so. I\u2019m so happy they got married and she was changed, but it stopped short there\u2026and the rest of the book didn\u2019t really seem to fit with the rest of the series because of this desertion. Edward \u2013 Did he DO something to SM? I mean, I feel like she TOTALLY slacked on his character in this book! I always thought he was her favorite as well, but he was just not a strong character in this book at all. Edward is what made Twilight so \u2018magical\u2019 for me. He was mysterious, romantic, beautiful, clever, intelligent; he was everything a knight in shining armor should be. Edward stole my heart by the 4th chapter. So much of that was lost in BD. You almost find yourself feeling sorry for him for becoming Bella\u2019s loyal lapdog. It just didn\u2019t feel right.Bella \u2013 The clumsy school girl turns perfect vampire in record time? Seriously? Where is the angst, sorrow, pain and sacrifice we were expecting? This is what made the love between Bella & Edward so fantastical, their willingness to sacrifice EVERYTHING for each other. Then there is no sacrifice? How is that fair. Everything was just too easy for Bella in this book. I realize now that Bella is SM\u2019s favorite character, not Edward. Bella gets to have the love of her life, amazing human sex, a baby (and we didn\u2019t have an inkling she WANTED to be a mother), and become a super powerful vamp with no \u2018newborn\u2019 stage at all (although I was happy to finally discover her immunity to the powers of others is actually a special talent of her own\u2026even though she did gain control over it a little too quickly for a newborn vamp, it\u2019s nice to have an explanation nonetheless). We should all be so lucky. It was very hard to get past how everything worked out so perfectly for Bella. Even the pain during her change was overshadowed by the fact she was capable of hiding it from Edward, she was that strong already. It was actually a little annoying, I guess. The conflict with Jacob is also easily repaired as he falls out of love with Bella the moment he realizes he has imprinted on her baby daughter. But as much as Bella can\u2019t live without Jacob, this news isn\u2019t good news for her; she\u2019s upset that it\u2019s worked out so perfectly for everyone. Like I said, a little annoying. Renesmee - I actually liked the chapter of Renesmee\u2019s birth the best. I was surprised, shocked, horrified, disgusted, absorbed, hopeful, worried, and much more. I actually felt SOMETHING, which is what was missing the most from this book compared to the others. I am in the minority, I think, in that I was happy to find out Bella was pregnant. Before I realized the fear Edward possessed over this unknown, I thought it would take a different direction. I should have known better. Either way, I still thought the surprise was a good one, and I didn\u2019t focus on the irrationality of a vampire siring a child because, well, come on people, we\u2019re talking fiction\u2026fantasy\u2026supernatural already, our minds should be open to all possibilities. I thought the explanation of why this was \u2018possible\u2019 was pretty believable. I also liked her special talent and how it was directly related to the talents of both her parents. However, I am NOT in the minority when I express the opinion that I despise the child\u2019s name. Renesmee? Are you kidding me? Thank goodness Jacob nicknamed her \u2018Nessie\u2019 and everyone followed suit, so I had to read that name less. Why not Carlie? I mean, really!Jacob \u2013 I actually liked Jacob more in this book than any other, I think. I was always \u2018Team Edward\u2019 when it came to Bella, but I still wanted Jacob to be happy. I kept hoping he would imprint on some nice girl and they would go double date with Bella & Edward. I even started to wonder if Leah was imprinting on Jacob and how that would work? I thought that would definitely be an interesting story line. But no. Things are tidied up nicely and Jacob imprints on Bella\u2019s daughter. Are we supposed to believe this is why they cared about each other SO much, because of his already existent attachment to her unborn child? And now he will become their son-in-law. Does that seem weird to anyone else? I expected this once we found out Bella gave birth to a daughter, but it was still a bit disappointing. I think Jacob could have ended up happy without Bella in a much more pragmatic way, personally.The Cullens \u2013 First I\u2019ll say I missed Alice tremendously!!! I said before BD came out that someone had to die, it just had to happen, and I speculated it would be Rosalie (I was right that someone had to die, luckily I didn't care about Irina one tiny bit). I figured she would be the easiest loss for the readers to swallow. So I was definitely surprised at the more frontline role she actually played in this book, and disappointed that Alice disappeared for so long. I also wish there was more story around the Cullens helping Bella as a newborn. Having her get control so quickly and easily was actually disappointing. I was looking forward to the expanding roles of each Cullen family member helping her through that time with their different strengths. I also wish we\u2019d had more of the other vampire tribes, I thought it was very interesting having them come together with different talents, histories and personalities. I go back to why this could have been two books, one giving the story of the wedding, the honeymoon, the baby, the change, and more of the newborn years\u2026yes, I wanted years; another giving more of the story of these new tribes and the battle against the Volturi. With all that being said, I want to reiterate that I did enjoy the book and I was very happy with the way it ended. I just wasn\u2019t as pleased with the story leading up to my desired ending. I wanted the \u2018happily ever after\u2019, but I wanted it to be more supernatural/vampire/even horror and less \u2018fairy tale\u2019 I guess. I hope SM gives us more of our favorite characters though, and that she takes a little more time to do so."}], "description": "To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable, consequences.
