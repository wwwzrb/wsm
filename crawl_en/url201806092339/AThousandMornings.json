It used to bother me that the \"rules\" of poetry were not clear. I didn't like puzzles that did not have answers and I don't have a literary decoder ring. I was never very good at memorizing passages (I can't even repeat a joke back to you in a way that keeps the funny). There were some other feeble excuses - most of which have absolutely nothing to do with poetry - but all that matters is that I kept on not reading poetry.*Quite a few years back, I happened upon my first Amy Hempel story and I was shocked awake. Words were powerful and messy and they hurt and healed like I didn't know was possible. The lesser lesson for me was how few words were needed to wield that power.*I started watching Poetry Slams on Youtube. I don't know why. There were some people that were SO amazing to watch! The seemingly random structure of poetry on a page made complete sense when you heard poetry being read, felt, and breathed in those slams.*I clicked my way through the internet to a blog that I had never been in a place to appreciate the other times I landed there. But this time, as I was reading, I felt like I was being squashed and pushed and pulled and my breathing changed and my brain sort of snapped. Those last movie scenes that the blogger described are still in my thoughts a year later. (http://www.amyturnsharp.com/blog/2011...) In 2012, she has been writing a poem a day and I am a loyal reader.So, I am trying to read poetry now and this is one of the first books of poetry that I have finished. I guess I am trying to tell you that I have no idea if this is stellar poetry or not, but I really liked it. I want to write out some of these poems several times just so they are more real.

It reminded me of the nature writings of Annie Dillard, the essays of Thoreau and Emerson, and the poems of Whitman and the Transcendentalists. Oliver could be an adopted poet of that movement.The poems are almost naked, sometimes abrupt, but if nature could speak, this is what she could say. Oliver is certainly awed by her surroundings, the sea, animals and the spirituality of nature. I think the best way to depict her style is to include one of her poems.I Go Down to the ShoreI go down to the shore in the morningand depending on the hour the wavesare rolling in or moving outand I say, oh, I am miserable,what shall\u2014what should I do? And the sea saysin its lovely voice:Excuse me, I have work to do.I had never heard of Mary Oliver before reading this little black and grey book of poems. I felt ignorant for not having heard of her. She is one of the most renowned poets of our time, a Pulitzer Prize winner and a recipient of the National Book Award. Pithy and stark, her new collection is a quick read, but you find yourself reading each poem over and over again.

I am somewhat sorry, because I would love to be able to appreciate it or at least to understand why other people love it so much. However, I seem incapable of wrapping my mind around it in the majority of the cases. This one seemed completely uninspiring to me. Indeed, usually I favour simplicity in literature over complicated and long-winded sentences because I have the opinion that the truth is generally something simple. But in case of this collection simple felt like boring and dull to me. There were moments when words were used in a way that made me pause and reflect and then feel a tiny bit impressed about the author's conclusions regarding certain topics so it is not like it was completely awful, but for the most part I was not impressed.

Her writing has consistently been self-reflective observances of and within nature, unexpectedly exposing our own poverty of a life without. In her world, she approaches life with a soft, and open inquisitiveness to the (mostly) silent earthly elders; the aging black oak, the sea (that speaks to her), wrens that pray, and ants that squirm for life in the midst of death. She writ large a life in nature, and though her work is not strongly political, she makes clear her concern in \"On Traveling To Beautiful Places\"\"But it's late, for all of us, and in truth the only ship there isis the ship we are all onBurning the world as we go.\"For a poet who has spent her life silently observing the world as if a \"pearl of water on the eider's glossy back,\" it must seem hopeless. What is most striking, is what is absent; anger, blame, indictments, rants, jokes, irony. The lack of these things, which are so much a part of the culture, might target her as a quaint nature writer, but this label would be a mistake. She doesn't have to write apocalyptic warnings about global warming, or fracking directly to get us thinking about what we're losing; she only has to let us glimpse in on her life that has been indelibly shaped by the lessons of nature.LINES WRITTEN IN THE DAYSOF GROWING DARKNESSEvery year we have beenwitness to it: how the world descendsInto a rich mash, in order thatit may resume.And thereforewho would cry outto the petals on the groundto stay, knowing as we must,how the vivacity of what was is marriedto the vitality of what will be?I don't say it's easy, butwhat else will doif the love one claims to have for the worldbe true?So let us go on, cheerfully enough,this and every crisping day,though the sun be swinging east,and the ponds be cold and black,and the sweets of the year be doomed."}, {"userName": "Adele", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4391209-adele", "userReview": "(A brief review I wrote for The Banner magazine)For almost 50 years, American poet Mary Oliver has been celebrated for her graceful inquisitions into the rhythms of the natural world.

In the past so many years I have celebratd the arrivals of Evidence, Thirst, Swan, and Red Bird. I have purchased at least five copies of her New and Selected Poems becasue I can\u2019t help but give them away when I meet someone who has never heard of her before. And each time I receive a new title it is my constant companion for weeks upon weeks. If you find it strange that a book of poems can be a companion, then you have not met a Mary Oliver poem yet.A Thousand Mornings is a slender volume, seventy-six pages, and yet how many hours of pleasure, contemplation and company it contains. When I read Oliver\u2019s poems I am always transported to my own experiences. The places she unfolds in her work are so similar to my favourite places at the farm, the creatures I encounter, the plants and trees and insects, that I am immersed in that world but with an even closer view. Because this is what Mary does, illuminates the most intricate details of what she notices, and somehow brings a universal light to the profound human experience as well. Amazement. Awe. Wonder. Gratitude. Reverence. For all that lives, and also dies.I have noticed over the past several books she has published that more and more she is slipping more personal, more intimate details of her own life within the words. Mary is notoriously private, rarely gives interviews, and has often spoke of how she keeps her private and personal life out of her work, at least in a confessional way. But in A Thousand Mornings there are several poems that are intimate to her life, much more so than in any of her other works. And yet there is still nothing confessional about them, only an expansive wisdom that never says, \u201cthis is the answer,\u201d but instead leaves only questions in the reader\u2019s mind. Mary Oliver is a poet who honours mystery. I find immense comfort in that.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "A BIT OF MUSING ABOUT POETRYI read an entire book of poetry!

There was not one poem I didn't like and many brought me either balm or a good kick in the pants, both needed because of the weird places my mind goes sometimes.I will read her again.

Though I will always like certain lines of Oliver's (she's never going to be bad, after all), I found most all of the poems in this book rather domesticated, unambitious, and even workshop-like at times, which is something I would not have expected from her. It's as if Oliver is attempting to allow the power of her elder self (her Mary Oliver-ness) carry the poems into greatness, instead of accessing the language or even the ignition the poems need to spark the same kind of aliveness in the reader. This is something we have seen, to be honest, in a good deal of American male poets, too. Truthfully, the poems are rather flat and, if these were anyone else's poems, I have a nagging feeling we would reject them quickly and outright. What I truly like about Oliver--her attentiveness to nature in contrast to the world of ambition and materialism--doesn't serve her well here in poems that don't resist against something. I would still love her to be my neighbor and friend, and perhaps she is at a very good place in her life, but it's just not good poetry, in my view. A more resigned or accepted version of life than we have encountered in earlier collections, surely, with far less power and excitement. Sigh."}, {"userName": "Lu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20829016-lu", "userReview": "A Thousand Mornings is a stunning poetry book. It captures the essence of nature, animals, and the small moments in life and transforms that into beautiful and deep poems. Each text - short though they may be - carries a different atmosphere and I couldn't help but get sucked inside each one of them, as if every paragraph was a novel of its own. I was surprised to have highlighted so many passages from this small compilation, especially considering I'm not a big poetry reader, so I can say without a doubt that this collection is a very good place to start if you're thinking about reading more poetry.My favourite passage from the book was this one (and even hours after finishing the book, I couldn't stop but think about this excerpt over and over again):\nSAID THE MOTHERYou are going to grow upand in order for that to happenI am going to have to grow oldand then I will die, and the blamewill be yours."}], "description": "In A Thousand Mornings, Mary Oliver returns to the imagery that has come to define her life\u2019s work, transporting us to the marshland and coastline of her beloved home, Provincetown, Massachusetts. In these pages, Oliver shares the wonder of dawn, the grace of animals, and the transformative power of attention. Whether studying the leaves of a tree or mourning her adored dog, Percy, she is ever patient in her observations and open to the teachings contained in the smallest of moments.Our most precious chronicler of physical landscape, Oliver opens our eyes to the nature within, to its wild and its quiet. With startling clarity, humor, and kindness, A\u00a0Thousand Mornings explores the mysteries of our daily experience.", "title": "A Thousand Mornings", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588404-a-thousand-mornings", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345433150l/13588404.jpg", "reviews": 824, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23988.Mary_Oliver", "name": "Mary Oliver"}], "type": ["Poetry", "Nonfiction", "Environment"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588404-a-thousand-mornings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36485473-a-thousand-mornings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290980-a-thousand-mornings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20666263-a-thousand-mornings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71642.New_and_Selected_Poems_Volume_One", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71654.Why_I_Wake_Early", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707772-dog-songs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71652.A_Poetry_Handbook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358559-upstream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
