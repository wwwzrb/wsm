That is, inconsistent with the other books.There are just so many things that make dubious sense in a way too short book, which doesn't even take advantage of the subplots and just lets them rot and eventually spoil the book.Not to mention that the actual plot was such a mess. Weak, really. Not a chance of any tension build-up.I am also very bothered by the logic, which, for the most part is nonexistent.The love scenes could have been a bit interesting, with Sookie's issues and stuff. But everything was \"repaired\" out of the nowhere and for no apparent good reason, leaving us \"wtf?\".First of all, Eric becomes just a love-blinded version of his old viking self, this time, being entirely unbespelled. It is really hard to believe his sudden transformation, given that lately he has not been through any traumatising, life-changing experience that could perhaps explain it. Why the sudden change in personality? There is no trace of the yummy, juicy character he was. I am having trouble imagining Alexandr Skarsgard portraying this Eric.Secondly, I feel that Sam was just shut from Sookie's universe. He basically had no impact in the plot whatsoever and he was just a filler character. Why then did Sookie go to dinner with him? Just to fill some pages? I was expecting some event taking place or something that might effect the novel in any way. Unfortunately, this book completely ignored Sam, even if it set the background for, perhaps, a more interesting role of him in a future book.Thirdly, the thing with Bill had so much potential which was just wasted. Why did Bill need her help in sending a bloody email? If all that subplot could be solved with just an email, why did Harris go through the trouble of even including it? I think it was very wrong of her not to dwell on this more. We just get the impression that Sookie sends and e-mail and then BAM, Bill is better and possibly, on with his sister - which of course, doesn't make sense given Bill's actions in the previous books, but I am sure that the writer will arrange for those two to get together. It was really disappointing that the Bill issue was solved in 5 lines and not given more attention in a book so short, which definitely had enough space for more development in this part.The FAIRY PART. This just a big fat NONSENSE to me. It is just illogic on so many levels!!! Why was Dermot put a spell on by Niall? And if so, why was he still against the good side in the war? If now he suddenly loved his family, how come he was against them. Why was the spell broken so easily? I am not referring to the actual way, but to the fact it took her 2 seconds to figure it out. Again, the book was so short and unsatisfying that this could have been easily exploited and developed. And why the fudge did they all end up in bed, like family? Why?I am seriously expecting to see Michael Jackson as vampire in the next book. Maybe Princess Diana too. Hm, who else? Let me think. Maybe Napoleon? Vlad the Impaler? Jimi Hendrix? Cliff Burton? Julius Caesar? William Wallace? Kurt Cobain? I am looking forward to see who will get the chance to be resurrected as a vampire.As to the actual plot, it was pretty much non-existent as well. No tension build-up at all because you don't know what the conflict is - oh, wait, there is none, except a fabricated one in the last 20 pages. Which of course, unravels with the speed of light and burns down equally fast.And why was a 100 year old vampire stronger than both a bad ass Viking and a creepy Roman???The were-wolf part was out of the nowhere as well. In the future, I expect more sub-plot development and a more substantial main plot, with an actual tension build up.P.S. The love scenes were quite crappy too!"}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3065167-stacy", "userReview": "Shannan and I love, LOVE this series. It is fun, never boring, filled with entertaining mysteries and is often quite humorous\u2026and other things I am too prudish to write.The book starts off with a very morose Sookie, but who can blame her after being tortured, physically and mentally? Slowly, and thankfully, Sookie does return to her Sookie self. Just in time really, because all her friends are having family issues and Sookie being Sookie, she is there to help. Oh, and there is a mystery of the new corpse on her land. Why I like Sookie in this book:\u00b7\tShe says crapanola, which I will probably use very often now.\u00b7\tShe loves Eric and tells him.\u00b7\tDespite the company, she always offers tea or coke. She could never let Gran think she wasn\u2019t hospitable. \u00b7\tShe is faithful to her family and friends 100%.\u00b7\tGradually (and with lots of Sookie spunk) overcomes her emotional and physical scars from the last book.\u00b7\tDid I mention that she said (more than once mind you) that she loves Eric?\u00b7\tShe doesn\u2019t play nice with bullies, i.e. FBI Agent Lattesta.\u00b7\tShe shows forgiveness (think Dermot.)\u00b7\tShe still babbles when nervous.\u00b7\tShe gives Eric special smiles.\u00b7\tShe eats Little Debbie\u2019s, shouldn\u2019t all heroines? Why I like Eric in this book:\u00b7\tHe is honorable, for a vamp anyway.\u00b7\tHe loves Sookie and tells her.\u00b7\tConcerned about the safety and well being of those in his territory. \u00b7\tTough and decisive, yet vulnerable when it comes to Sookie.\u00b7\tHis helplessness at the end of the book, shows his vulnerability.\u00b7\tHis house rule, no shoes.\u00b7\tHe calls Sookie, \u201cmy lover.\u201d Cheesy, I know. Normally, I would hate this.\u00b7\tHe drives a corvette. Okay, so I really don\u2019t like this. I think it is a trashy car, but it really fits the bill though.\u00b7\tDid I mention that he tells Sookie he loves her?Here are some things that I noticed in the book, in no particular order. Jason seems to have majorly matured since the last book, he even gives Pam some blood. Wonder what this will mean in the next book? Talking about blood exchange, there was none going on between Sookie and Eric, hmmm. The whole Alexei thing was creepy, due to his age. CH did explain it well, but I still found it gross. I also found the were political \u201cthing\u201d in congress and Eric\u2019s explanation of vampire territory in the US boring. I can only think this is a set-up for the next book or so. Oh, and I am not sure what to think about Bill and his \u201csibling.\u201d Finally, finally Sookie address the big question, immortality! My only question, who was the vampire smelled in Sookie\u2019s woods, and if it was Bill what does that mean? Has he been spying on her?Overall, I think I expected too much from this book. I mean I really liked it. It was just not the best one in the series (think book 4.) There was not enough Eric/Sookie time, the political stuff was boring, and honestly the plot was a little yawn-ish.I give this book 4 STACKSStacy \u2013 who now has to wait another whole year for the next book! visit girlsinthestacks.com for more book reviews, author interviews and more!"}, {"userName": "Mrs. Badass", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2566231-mrs-badass", "userReview": "Disappointing to say the least. The whole book was rather boring. There were a few interesting parts, but overall, I skimmed a lot because it didn't add to the plot or story, and I was very irritated with the lack of Eric and Sookie. It seemed like Harris is trying to tell us they won't end up together. With Eric's Maker telling Sookie that she'll never keep Eric, with Bill confessing more, with Alcide confessing more, With Eric being absent a lot, and no communication with Sookie for days at at time. I don't know, I feel rather cheated with this book. The last few books have felt like major filler books, to pass the time and make money, but not really developing anything new in Sookie land.

I'm not exactly sure how I felt about this one, it was just kind of meh. There were too many storylines going on and things were tied up way too neatly. I've also come to the realization that I like Sookie and Eric better when she's fighting her attraction to him. As a couple, they've kind of lost their appeal, which is weird, because he's always been my favorite pick for her. I think Charlaine writes better sexual tension and conflict than actual sex scenes.The title of this installment is ridiculously accurate; the story revolves around almost every character's family. It got to the point though that things started to get convoluted. We've got Sookie's two cousins, Eric's \"brother\" and his maker, Bill's family and his \"sister,\" Tara's pregnancy, and Sam's problems with his family all thrown into the mix. On top of that, people are calling for the Weres to be registered, and even though that storyline seemed like it should have taken precedence, it gets thrown by the wayside in favor of all the drama. This one was ... weird. I saw that a lot of people thought it started off slow and boring, but I never felt that way. It moves at a leisurely pace and Sookie isn't running from danger at every turn, but I was never bored. Maybe I was just happy to be with these characters again. This novel feels like filler for sure, but I wasn't completely disappointed by the storyline. There were some interesting things that we finally have answers to, but I thought the main mystery was figured out too easily. Although, at this point it makes sense that Sookie can figure out things a little quicker now; she's got more experience and more resources to help her out. There just wasn't that suspense and tension that I look for in Charlaine's books this time around though.Even though the main mystery was solved and many things were tied up neatly, some interesting new questions have been thrown into the mix at the end. I'm not completely disappointed with this book, but I really wish I didn't have to wait a year for the next one when this one was lacking that certain special something I've come to expect when I read her books.

Anything would be an improvement over you letting your imagination continue to run amok in Bon Temps.I probably wouldn't mind so much if ANYTHING HAPPENED in this 300 page travesty of a \"book\" but I guess you were too busy counting your True Blood royalties to bother too much with a little detail like that. Instead you wanted to write 20 page scenes about taking Sookie's telepathic cousin to the park or the funeral of an incredibly minor character who you have only ever mentioned in passing before. Why should we care? You allude to much, but in the end you say NOTHING and I'm left bitter that I waited anxiously for this book to finally be returned to the library so that I could read it.I would have been better off watching this Snoop Dogg fan video again.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the book and would've given it a 3.5 had it been an option.My biggest problem is that while I know this is a clearly a transitional book, very little happens that is of consequence (if we're being set up for something big in a later book, Harris has done a poor job of building tension/momentum). It was also very choppy, as if significant edits were made and you can see the lines where the plot was glued back together, but it doesn't come together cohesievely every time. Finally, the poor introduction of new characters. Faces that had become so familiar over the last few books are gone one way or another(Amelia, Octavia, Tray, Caludine, etc) and new people (beings?) are introduced. The character developement is weak at best and non-existent at worst. (And seriously, Charlaine- no mention of what happened to Arlene after she tried to kill Sookie? Is she rotting in jail? Did she get off scott-free? You mananged to make mention of things that happened five books ago and anyone familiar with the Sookie-verse would know it already, but you can't follow up with Arlene? But maybe I should just be happy that Sookie is wearing her hair up in a scrunchie anymore and you aren't mentioning it every chapter.)However, there were several things I *did* like. Jason- finally growing up. Eric telling Sookie just *why* he didn't come to rescue her right away in the previous book. Sookie- not being a vampire doormat. All these are good things, but I wasn't left wanting MORE MORE MORE like I have been after the last few books.I hope Harris takes some time off between this book and the next one and really thinks about where she's going with Sookie's story, and give it the thoughful attention it deserves."}, {"userName": "valee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320890-valee", "userReview": "This book was not what I expected. I waited so long for it that I just wanted more of it. I mean after all the time it took to get published, the book could have been a bit longer. Still it was much better than the previous book.I loved to finally see Sookie and Eric in a real relationship. It seemed so natural. I was extremely happy as well because Sookie even considered how it would be to be changed into a vampire. Finally. Although she didn't give much thought to it, just a paragraph,lol, and not a real answer.My problem with this book was that nothing really important happened. After having read about wars,conferences and congresses between the sups, the plot in this book seemed a bit weak. And as all the \"enemies\" appeared and died in this very same book, it seemed as a poor addition to the series. I think it would have been better if we had get more Victor in it and more about the sups we already knew. But there were some great things in the book. First, I loved this new side of Claude. I really liked him and I think he will turn a great character in the next books, as well as Dermot. I love the family aspect and how it's developing. I hope they stay in the series as good guys because I really like the 2 fairies. They make everything more interesting. I loved as well to see this more mature side of Jason, because in the previous books he had annoyed me tremendously. And it couldn't have been invented a better ending to the Bill Drama. I loved how everything turned out.I think this was a great book, which gave closure to a lot of problems that had been going on but were not a very big deal. This book was like a transition between what had been going on and what will happen next. I believe everything has been presented to give us the idea that something very big will be going on next book. Can't wait. I love this series, although I'm not sure how I will tolerate the waiting.

Dead in the Family is really just a filler book between the Fairy battle of last book and the inevitable show down with the King of Louisiana and his people to come.This makes it hard to review because, to be honest, nothing really happens. We have what I would call a short story \"arc\" to bridge us between what I would consider the main story. Sookie finishes up in this book much the same as she started though she has undergone some very positive character upgrades since the beginning of the series.The writing is okay, the mystery is flat and the end is kind of a let down but this book isn't bad. I think it's just not what I came to expect from this series and frankly, I felt like this book didn't really need to happen.The positive parts are the characters of Jason and Claude who get a happy little depth and improvement to them. The relationship between Sookie and Eric is nice.However that's all I can really say about this book. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't a page turner and it doesn't really leave me hanging out for the next one.I hate to say it but maybe it's time for Sookie's story to come to a nice close but I wonder how much there really is left to tell.

Displeased with Sookie\u2019s attitude and the overall plot of Dead and Gone, I was reluctant to start Dead in the Family. Concern that the series had finally lost its luster made me hold off. I was a fool.Dead in the Family is a wonderful addition to the Southern Vampire Mysteries. The dialogue is comfortable, the characters are true to form, and the plot rolls along steadily, touching on all the key threads that make this series a success. Harris returns to Bon Temps as spring takes hold, bringing with it change and growth so clearly reflected in the story.Launching with a prologue, Harris offers a window into how the characters are coping after so much horror. I\u2019m glad Ms. Harris took the time to touch on Sookie\u2018s healing process; her progression from depression to resignation, to the realisation she wants to live, to finally being able to wrestle some happiness out of life, was powerful and necessary. Though Sookie is certainly more cynical than she once was, it was nice to see her confidence and her fiesty attitude return. Dead in the Family brings practical Sookie back to the fore (with a little more ruthlessness thrown in).The obvious theme of this book is family: Sookie\u2019s and Eric\u2019s primarily, with reinforcement from Bill, Sam, Tara, and even characters who are just passing through. Offering several relationships to compare and contrast, Harris displays both the positive and negative aspects of familial ties. All of the connections were interesting, some were heartbreaking, and others - like Sookie\u2019s relationship with her cousin, Hunter - were filled with promise. I enjoyed this theme and the questions it raised about Sookie\u2019s future. I suspect there\u2019s a lot of foreshadowing scattered throughout, and I\u2019m starting to build some theories on how the series will wrap up.Having Eric\u2019s maker around was not as thrilling as anticipated. I couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed that he didn\u2019t cause a lot more turmoil. Despite that, Eric\u2019s vulnerability was a sight to behold and well worth dealing with the lack-luster Roman. Eric and Sookie. I like the progress. I\u2019m enjoying seeing them relate to one another in a more open way. I\u2019m glad we got an answer to the \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come?\u201d question that\u2019s been plaguing us all. At the same time, I wish this book had given them more space for heart-to-heart conversations. Even more than Sookie\u2019s love life, I wanted to explore the continuing predicament with the new ruling parties. I\u2019m eager to dive into the full political implications of Victor\u2019s behaviour, Felipe\u2019s reign, and Eric\u2019s precarious position. I suspect this is a slow build up to major maneuvering. Bring on the vampire intrigue! Speaking of supernatural politics: Since outing themselves to the rest of the world, the shape shifters have had an increasingly rough time of it. In an example of solid storytelling, updates on Sam\u2019s family offered a tidy and welcome way of highlighting the problems the general shifter community must face. Finally, the fae. They\u2019ve been my primary issue with the series as of late. They aren\u2019t as well-developed as Harris\u2019 other races, so I\u2019ve never felt invested in them. And I can\u2019t stand Niall\u2019s selfishness and lack of foresight. That said, the mystery fae mentioned in the blurb came as quite a surprise. A welcome one, since the motivations behind the lurking were understandable and even helped tie up some loose ends. For once, the inclusion of the fae didn\u2019t drive me batty. As I mentioned, I see a good deal of foreshadowing in this book. Knowing the series will soon end, I can\u2019t help but examine every little detail more closely. I\u2019m terrible that way - always trying to suss out how the author will leave things. In this case, Harris has given me much to ponder over the next five months."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060045-jen", "userReview": "This review is for an ARC.I would say that Charlaine wasn't joking when she said the title for this book was very apt. It is all about family. Blood families and packs alike. I liked how each corner of the Sookieverse gets a look in, and something about that family is developed - the humans, the fairies, the weres and the vampire families all get story time. The character of Eric is filled in wonderfully in this book, and his fans will be delighted with how he, his history, and his family are written. I won't say more and ruin anything, but I thought it was fun that we finally got to find out a little about where the great man rests his head. Bill, Sam and Alcide all get appropriate chunks of the story, and the virtues and vices of each become clearer to Sookie. I feel like I can now see a glimmer of who she will end up with when all is said and done. Speaking of Sookie herself, she is a much darker character in Dead in the Family. She has suffered a lot, and struggles on a daily basis to keep that suffering in check. She has more moxie than before (if that was possible) and seems to be developing a new catchphrase... 'geez Louise'. I'm not sure I like that, but it sure is a Sookie-phrase! She speaks her mind more, and is inevitably more wary.At 295 pages, the book is about the right length, and it is split into 3 definite parts. The start deals with Sookie's recovery from the events at the end of Dead and Gone, the middle delves into the family theme in detail, and the ending is very Shakespearian. At times I felt like the story was meandering, and lacked the clear focus of other Sookie books; the mystery in this one is smaller, and less pressing. However I feel that in order to continue the series, this book is absolutely pivotal to collect up all the many threads which have been written, tie a few together, and leave us ready for the next installment - which must surely focus on the legal implications of the werecommunity's revelation. I'd give this 4.5 stars if possible, as I really really enjoyed it, but I felt the necessary meandering stole a little of the urgency away from the story."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2718225-alyssa", "userReview": "Review posted at Hesperia Loves BooksLet me start off by saying that this series is truly one of my favorites and I always eagerly anticipate any new books when they are released. Unfortunately, I can't say that this book was well worth the wait. I felt like I was waiting for the real story to begin the entire book. There were too many plot lines going and none of them really made a whole lot of sense. You began with Eric/Victor issues but after a certain point it was almost as if that storyline was forgotten. To me nothing from this book added to the series story progression and I was very disappointed in the lack of relationship interaction between Eric/Sookie. I know that CH has signed on for 3 more books after #11 so hopefully all of those will be much better. I would rather have fewer books and great stories than more 'just ok' stories to produce more books. Positives:1. Eric 'My Lover' (Eric being involved is always a positive)2. Hunter's appearance - finally after so long3. Jason growing up (taking care of Sookie)4. Alcide (nice Alcide, not mean & bitter)5. Bill talking to Caroline Bellfleur & acknowledging he was her Great-Great Grandfather6. Finally finding out why Eric wasn't able to get to Sookie when she was held captive.Negatives1. Not enough Eric/Sookie relationship (they admit they love each other, but they barely have any scenes together in the book. And no I'm not just talking about sex scenes either)2. Eric's maker -Appius Livius Ocella & Alexei -WTF!3. No story progression - was this a short story?4. Weres! I love a good werewolf or shifter just like the next gal, but come on. At least give me a good story, the only good thing was Alcide!5. I had to wait a year for this, WTH!

They are not great works of literature and not written terribly well, and yet I never cease to enjoy them. Same applies to this newest addition to the Sookie Stackhouse series - Dead in the Family, only this book adds another dimension to the expression \"guilty pleasure,\" because more than any other book in this series it has a soap-operish feel to it.For one, it is virtually impossible to give a short summary of this installment, mainly because nothing major happens in it. Rather, it wraps up all unfinished business left after Dead and Gone. Specifically:1) how will Sookie deal with her memories of fairy torture?2) will Bill recover after silver poisoning?3) will Eric and Sookie finally define their relationship?4) did all fairies leave the human world with Niall?5) will Sookie train her young cousin Hunter to manage his telepathic abilities?All these plot threads are tied together very loosely and in fact should have been a part of the epilogue to Dead and Gone.What serves as a sort of main mystery line - some werewolf business - is very thin and has just enough \"meat\" for a decent short story.And second, what is with a sudden epidemic of pregnancy and return of long-lost relatives? You might think I hated the book, but it's not so. It was an easy, enjoyable read. Harris has an ability to keep me interested even while describing the most mundane things, her characters are very vivid too. Reading about Eric was a pleasure, but his presence in Dead in the Family was minimal and there was almost no smut (I am not counting that one weird \"tryst\" when even no clothes came off)! I am also glad the author finally abandoned the fairy story line, because let's face it, her fairy lore was a big time joke. Harris should stick to what she does best - weres', vamps', and shapeshifters' politics. Dead in the Family is definitely one of the weakest books in the series. It seems Charlaine Harris is grasping at straws here, attempting to extend the series as much as she possibly can. I realize it and yet, I'll be reading the next book.

She takes the most boring and mundane details of life in a small town and makes it an interesting and humorous read. I had to chuckle when a comment was made about the patrons of Merlotte\u2019s singing Bad Things by Jace Everett so loud that Sookie couldn\u2019t hear the conversation she was having with Sam. So many things happen in this book. The weres are coming out and this would have been a great story line if only more time was given to it. Instead we get a few little anti-were protests. I did enjoy the were politics. I did miss Alcide and I now have a new respect for his role as an Alpha. The vampire politics and intrigue continued. As I continue on with this series, I really do appreciate Pam more and more. She is one astute player, carefully thinking out the repercussions of any move that can or will be made. Eric was different in this book. He kind of seemed defeated, maybe a little bit softer than in previous books. I miss the Viking Eric. I noticed a few things that are very different from the TV series, notably on the vampire back stories. In the book, Eric\u2019s maker is Appius Livius, not Godric. Honestly, I prefer Godric to this character. Bill\u2019s back story also differs a little. Bill has a shining moment when he makes peace with his human family. What would a Sookie book be without some sort of fairy story line? Claude the most gorgeous fairy misses being with his kind so he becomes Sookie\u2019s new roommate. Oh, and did anyone notice the mini baby boom in Bon Temps?

This book failed to meet them completely. In fact, it was so poorly written (and plotted), I could not even finish it, skipping from here to there, as though it were a collection of disjointed short stories. My personal opinion is that since True Blood debuted on HBO, Charlaine Harris has lost her Mojo. She doesn't even seem to know who her characters are any more. Granted, True Blood is definitely the Alternate Sookieverse, and light years removed from these charming books. You either like it or you don't. (I don't, except for parts of Season 2). BUT...True Blood should have little or no effect on the \"Real\" Bon Temps and its residents, as have been carefully detailed & developed by Harris over many years.In Dead In The Family, Sookie behaves in ways that are totally foreign to the kindhearted & plucky girl we learned to love over time. Her treatment of Bill was abominable, as though his dying of silver poisoning was nothing much to her, even though he acquired it saving her life. Her relationship with Eric is domestic to the point of being sickening. (Who wants Eric Northman all tamed down and husbandly, anyway?) Even 2nd and 3rd tier characters sound & behave nothing like themselves at all. Maybe this was what Harris planned all along, but I can't help but feel she has lost her way with the series, and really ought to bring it to an end. It's the humane thing to do.Meanwhile, with a plethora of Urban Fantasy books available at every store, I have decided to bid Sookie farewell.

As Sookie recovers from torture suffered during the fae conflict, she learns of a bequest left her in a fairy will. She also learns the magnitude of her great grandfather\u2019s influence when the FBI call off their enquiry. After reluctantly seeing off her houseguest, Amelia, Sookie is puzzled when her newly-discovered cousin wants to share her house, citing loneliness, but kindness overpowers scepticism, and she agrees. Sookie consents to look after (and counsel) her telepathic young nephew, Hunter, for an overnight stay. But a were and a vampire tracker alert Sookie to the presence of unknown fairies in the woods out back of her house, as well as a couple of buried corpses. Vampire Bill is still suffering silver poisoning; some less-than-welcome family members come calling on Eric; and Sookie discovers a government spy in their midst. As usual, attempts are made on Sookie\u2019s life; someone tries to frame her for a murder; and she grudgingly takes on the temporary role of shaman for Alcide\u2019s pack. There\u2019s a bit of vampire politics, a bit of were activism, a protest rally, and some vampire spies. A spell is broken by a kiss and, by the end, there are quite a few deaths. The highlight of this instalment is Hunter\u2019s interaction with Sookie.

Compared to the other books, I felt that there was a lack of action and in some respects, a lack of a strong plot. Sure, we learned some of Eric and Bill's background, and Sookie is taking steps to connect with her fae side as well as her cousin Hadley's telepathic son, but what else happened? There was no strong development or resolution with the tense vampire political situation (huge missed opportunity) or any of Sookie's relationships (with Eric, Bill, or Sam) even in her own mind. Honestly, I can't tell what she wants anymore and I'm starting to think that Charlaine Harris just doesn't want to commit to anything because 1)she has no idea where the series is going 2)she is making a lot of money and is therefore dragging out the inevitable (ie: having sookie get off vamps once and for all or come up with plan B such as decide to be turned). Another aspect of this book that drove me bonkers is all the summarizing of the other books. I felt like half of the book was reminding me what happened in previous books. I'm sure with the success of True Blood, there are tons of new readers but they certainly shouldn't be jumping in at book 10! It seemed like a waste of valuable pages that I would have preferred be devoted to NEW stuff.I know it sounds like I didn't like the book, but I honestly did enjoy it... just not AS MUCH as the previous books. There were so many things that were left undone and I felt let down after so much anticipation. I know that it must be hard for Charlaine Harris to make the fans pf the books and the HBO show happy so I don't want to seem like I am complaining.

This is not to say that I thought the book was bad because that\u2019s not it. It just didn\u2019t have the \u201cspark\u201d that some of her previous novels had. In this particular book, you can feel the weight of Sookies problems that have been resting on her shoulders due to the ordeal she had with the Fae war. This makes the book rather dark and depressing to be honest. Sookie is not her usual light hearted self in this one. I suppose it makes sense due to everything she went through in the previous book but when I pick up one of these novels I do so because they are usually an all-time favorite and because I find them lighthearted and fun. This is not what this one is like though so I hope in the next book Sookie will be back to being more herself. In this book, we see the aftermath of the Fae War. As I said before, it is pretty dark and depressing and the characters aren\u2019t as light hearted and fun as we have grown to see, know, and love. Many of the secondary characters play light roles in this one as well. Alcide makes an appearance but I wish to have seen more of him. The same goes to Eric and Bill. Sookie of course is apparent throughout this book. Here she is trying to figure out which fairy did not go through the portal when it was closed. She isn\u2019t necessarily being stalked so there isn\u2019t a huge aura of mystery here but there are some underlying issues that need to be handled in this one. Pretty much, this is the extent of the book. Once again, while I am a huge Sookie Stackhouse fan this one just ultimately fell flat for me. It was a bit drabber than the others.

What was I thinking? Love this series and can't wait until the next book comes out - May 2011!!!!!!PREVIOUS REVIEW - After reading this book, I remember why this series is one of my top 5 favorites. It's like the Look candy bar to me. During my pregnancy with my oldest daughter I would walk to the store each workday and buy one because they were so good and it forced me to take a walk. And then over years, I've eaten other candy bars and loved them. I remembered I liked Look a lot but the others have become as good or better. But then I eat a Look candy bar now and I remember why it was so good and one of my favorites. Okay, I'm craving candy and it's 12:45 a.m. I can't wait until the next book comes out! I realize a lot of people didn't like how depressed Sookie was but really, after seeing so many people die, people that she really liked and may even have loved, and then to have parts of her be literally eaten slowly, how could anyone just bounce back? I wish this vampire marriage thing would be firmed up, maybe have a human marriage to make it more real for her? Hope that's in the next book.

Although this was still a good installment in the series, I feel that, compared to the previous novels, this book was not up to par. It seemed more like a filler than anything else and most of it seemed somewhat obscure.Of course, I loved reading about Eric, the studly Viking vampire. He has always been an interesting character for me, but I felt that even the circumstances around him were lacking. Too much time was spent revolved around his maker and \"brother\" to the point where we didn't really get much of just Eric. I, also, felt odd seeing Eric acting so differently around his maker. While I know it's true that vampires have to do whatever their makers tell them to, I was a little freaked out that Eric was so...obedient. When his maker and \"brother\" died at the end, I was relieved right alongside Sookie and Eric better get back to being the arrogant, bossy, Viking vampire he's always been in the next book.One of the weirdest parts for me was when Eric's maker and \"brother\" showed up and Sookie started acting crazy. It was just...weird, and I read that part as fast as I could because it was so obscure.The few times when Sookie interacted with Bill were pointless, in my opinion. I get the connection: Bill was still healing from the Fae War. Cool. And I'm glad Sookie found a way to heal him, but those parts just didn't seem to fit into the book anywhere important. Also, while I loved how shocked Andy and Portia were to find out they were related to Bill, I'm not exactly sure what purpose that served either. Although, I was glad that they finally got what they deserved where Bill was concerned.In the past few books, I have had pretty negative feelings towards Jason, but in this book, I have grown to like him again. He has mellowed out since Crystal's death, and I hope he stays that way. I like the nice, considerate Jason. He's making an effort to be a good friend, brother, panther, etc. and I really hope he doesn't let me down again.I was very happy to see more of Alcide and the Long Tooth Pack in this book. Alcide has not been in the past few books very much and so it was good to become reacquainted with him. Also, I think a part of me still holds out hope that he and Sookie will one day be together for real.It was odd to see a different side to Claude and it was nice that he moved in with Sookie to protect her. I'm glad, also, that they were able to break the spell over Dermot and he's not so crazy now.While I enjoy the character that is Hunter, I felt that his time with Sookie was way to extensively described. It's nice that she's helping him out, but I also felt that his and Remy's reappearance in this novel was way too abrupt. Previously, they had been in only one other book, and that was several novels ago. I think that, if Charlaine Harris was going to bring him into the story as an actual character, that it would have been nice to see a little more of him previously so that he was brought in a way that was so out of the blue.Overall, the novel was good, but it was not the best I've read. I eagerly await the arrival of the next book and sincerely hope that it will be far better than Dead in the Family turned out to be."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: It's all about family ...Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a whole host of family problems, ranging from her own kin (a non-human fairy and a telepathic second cousin) demanding a place in her life, to her lover Eric's vampire sire, an ancient being who arrives with Eric's \"brother\" in tow at a most inopportune moment. And Sookie's tracking down a distant relation of her ailing neighbor (and ex), Vampire Bill Compton.In addition to the multitude of family issues complicating her life, the werewolf pack of Shreveport has asked Sookie for a special favor, and since Sookie is an obliging young woman, she agrees. But this favor for the wolves has dire results for Sookie, who is still recovering from the trauma of her abduction during the Fairy War.My Review: This is book ten in the thirteen-book series, and somehow I never got around to reviewing it before. I've unearthed it for a re-read preparatory to reading the series finale soon.Sookie's world, that is the one created for her by Miss Charlaine, is a very rich and varied one. It's amazing to me the depth of the population's weirdness and otherness, and the reason I've kept reading is at least partly that depth. There are so many rules when world-building, and each of them must make sense in the context of the story being told, and form a part of the overall trend of the story or series if it is to be believable. Well, that's a specialty of these tales!Another big part of my pleasure in the books is the realness of the fantasy. Harris has created slang for her supes, \"deader\" being the rude term \"twoeys\" (the two-natured, or weres) use for \"vamps\" (human slang for vampires); \"oneys\" then are civilian humans to the weres, though the vamps call us \"breathers.\" It's all very organic for a series of books about a character who is the nexus for a lot of contact among these parties that otherwise wouldn't take place. Of course any group comes up with names for the other, different, competing groups! Naturally. And so Miss Charlaine provides.This entry in the series does several things that needed doing, snips off some very unprofitable lines of story and blooms open others, and makes a few of the unpalatable fae characters come more alive. Eric, played on TV by the gorgeous Alexander Skarsgard, and Sookie are deeply enmeshed in a relationship that makes Sookie do some very, very against-the-grain things in this book. They're totally understandable, and they add to the sense of the books as lived-life stories as improbable as that sounds.I liked the ending of this book about the best of them all that I've read.

But this favour for the wolves has dire results for Sookie, who is still recovering from the trauma of her abduction during the Fairy War.", "title": "Dead in the Family\n      \n          (Sookie Stackhouse #10)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7091488-dead-in-the-family", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1290479828l/7091488.jpg", "reviews": 5412, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17061.Charlaine_Harris", "name": "Charlaine Harris"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7091488-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13558757-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7519167-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6897351-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6933473-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8442234-dead-in-the-family", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301082.Dead_Until_Dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140077.Dead_to_the_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110494.Living_Dead_in_Dallas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140082.Club_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170210.Dead_as_a_Doornail", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
