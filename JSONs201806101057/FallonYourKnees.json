Other stupid people won't read a book just because Oprah picked it to be part of her club. The second group of stupid people think they are very smart though, and they are usually pretentious windbags who say very stupid shit but with big words that people are supposed to be impressed with. The people in the second group will never read this awesome book, and I don't feel sorry for them because they don't deserve it. (A note: Of the second group they will also whine when a book from Oprah Book Club 2.1 (ie., the second incarnation of the book club which began with John Steinbeck's East of Eden, and was in it's 2.0 manifestation only going to be for dead authors, but then morphed into 2.1 to include such titles as The Road, and Measure of a Man) they want to buy is now affixed with the Oprah wrapper or sticker. They will now whine about the little blemish in the same way they whine when the book they now want to read has just been made into a movie and only comes with a movie cover. In both cases these people are bandwagon jumpers but don't want to seem like bandwagon jumpers and by buying the new edition of the book they will be seen as no different from the ignorant masses they so deeply despise. Again they deserve what they get, especially since everyone knows that you can goto a used bookstore and buy an old cover, and if you really need to lie to yourself and everyone around you, you can claim that the 1960's beat up mass-market copy of Steinbeck you bought was really bought by you in a much better condition when you were thirteen, and now you have worn the book down by your constant reading of it, and because of that you know the book soooooo much better than anyone else alive)."}, {"userName": "Wilma", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45847087-wilma", "userReview": "Episch familiedrama gesitueerd in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, rond 1900...pijnlijk, rauw...daardoor ook mooi...De jonge pianostemmer James wordt verliefd op de dertienjarige Materia...Haar ouders staan niet achter haar keuze en ze worden verbannen.

It was painful to read. I spent a good 3 hours trying to read this book and ended up skimming the rest of it so I could be done with it. MacDonald covers just about every topic in her book: racial tension, isolation, domestic abuse, and forbidden love, which leads to incest, death, and even murder, but does it in a very complicated way that will turn many readers away. I consider myself a strong reader-one who has fantastic reading comprehension but this book tests even the strongest of readers. I felt that I had to read for days in order to get the jest of what she wrote about 30-50 pages back. It was ridiculous.I consider myself pretty open to reading just about anything but this one just was too much....I think I'll stick to my VC Andrews for my abuse and incest stories. She does them so much better than MacDonald did...and that's not saying much is it?I'll give it 1 star but to be honest I wish Zero stars was an option...maybe even negative ones.

Out of the 69 titles that she chose only 13 (19%) have appeared in at least any of the three (2006, 2008, 2010) editions of Boxall\u2019s 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die:4 by TONI MORRISON (Beloved, The Bluest Eye, Sula and Song of Solomon)  2 by CHARLES DICKENS (A Tale of the Two Cities and Great Expectations)2 by GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ (One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera) 1 each by LEO TOLSTOY (Anna Karenina), ALAN PATTON (Cry, My Beloved Country), JONATHAN FRANZEN (The Corrections), BARBARA KINGSOLVER (The Poisonwood Bible), BERNARD SCHLINK (The Reader), and ANN-MARIE MACDONALD. Wait, Ann-Marie, who?You see, for me, her name does not really ring a bell. Similar to the names of others in the list like Pearl Cleage, Sheri Reynolds, Mary McGarry Morris, Edwidge Danticat, Billie Leats, Bret Lott, Melinda Haynes, Breena Clarke, Gwyn Hayman Rubio and Malika Oufkir. I think, they all became household names because their books were picked by Oprah. What was being included in the Most Influential People lists for so many years if she could not rally people to read her chosen books. I must admit that I read David Wroblewski\u2019s The Story of Edgar Sawtelle and Ken Follett\u2019s The Pillars of the Earth because of Oprah\u2019s stamp. However, I have had no motivation to read right away her other choices including Fall on Your Knees because of what Jonathan Franzen said in the interview that Oprah\u2019s picks catered more for readers who were women than men.On the superficial level, that still is my main comment for this book, Fall on Your Knees by Ann-Marie MacDonald. The story of 3 sisters: Kathleen the eldest. She is beautiful, a musical genius and an apple of the eye of his father; Mercedes, may not be as pretty as her siblings but she stood as the mother for her sisters when their mother died; Frances is as beautiful as Kathleen and she suffered in the hands of their father when the latter came back from the war. Joining them is Lily who is the daughter of Kathleen and a twin of the baby infant Ambrose who accidentally died in the hands of Frances when he and Lily were born. The 3 sisters\u2019 mother, Materia completes the list of female characters. She is the only daughter of a wealthy Lebanese businessman. She defied her parents who wished that she would marry a dentist by eloping with her husband, James. So, the only male main character is the father James who may be good-intentioned and has big dreams for her children but he is weak to resist temptation and to overcome the psychological effects of war.So, there you go: 5 strong female characters versus 1 weak male character. So the mostly female adorers of Oprah cheer and clap their hands when Oprah raises the book and says \u201cHail, hail, read this book as I could not keep my hands from flipping over the pages while reading this!\u201dHowever, for me, there are three saving graces for this book. And this maybe the reason why Oprah just flipped and flipped the pages till the wee hours of the morning:1. Brilliant first chapter that begins with \u201cThey are all dead now\u201d then you follow the camera that zooms in to the things that the previous occupants of the house possessed and used.2. Character-driven plot. Mac-Donald\u2019s characters are bigger than the old familiar themes (family love, sisterly love, incest, war, etc) that we have all seen in the movies and read in similar books. Jane Smiley\u2019s A Thousand Acres easily came to my mind. For one, MacDonald was never melodramatic and you don\u2019t close the book feeling emotionally cheated.3. Having said that, the denouement is well-handled. The use of the family tree not only wraps up the whole story but it provides the symbolism of the book\u2019s main theme: family love, that no matter what we do, at the end of our lives, what matters most is our family. Then when you close the book, you know who the narrator of the first chapter should be. Well thought of novel. Well organized. Well written. For a first time writer, this is just amazing. Now, I no longer wonder why the Boxall\u2019s 1001 editors chose this book over the more popular Oprah titles like The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, The Pillars of the Earth, The Road, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, East of Eden, I Know This Much is True, She\u2019s Come Undone or The Deep End of the Ocean."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Opet poetska kanadska autorka i opet veliko MUST READ...

It is absolutely amazing. It's scandalous, it's real, it's intriguing, it's just plain -good-! MacDonald's writing style creates an interactive world that pulls you in to first person view of the characters' lives. The story follows the Piper family, a unique little set up of father and four daughters. Mr. Piper's wife has passed, leaving him to fend for himself in a home bursting to the seams with the drama of being a young girl growing up with three other sisters. Kathleen, the eldest of the girls, has been sent away to live out her father's vision of fame and perfection with her glorious voice. Left behind are Frances (a fiesty middle child who lives by her own rules), Lily (the youngest of the four, living with a crippled leg and a strong desire to please and do good), and Mercedes (the second eldest, longing to take the place of their late mother and following her faith closely and fiercely). Each girl has their own story which is brimming with secrets that are both outrageous and real. Mystery is around every corner, and controversy hides behind each one. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be \"intense\". Every story is intertwined in surprising and unexpected ways. It's difficult to not fall in love with someone in the novel because there really is somebody for everyone to relate to. If you can stomach some harsh, dramatic reality with believable characters in a world covered with a dark veil of the unexpected, then this book may be the right way to go."}, {"userName": "BrokenTune", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune", "userReview": "Lily stays sitting. \u201cFrances.

And I don\u2019t want the Devil to get after you.\u201d \u201cIs the Devil after you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis is Ann-Marie MacDonald's debut novel. I need to keep reminding myself about this fact that it's a debut novel because it is a polished work of complexity and beauty. Fall on Your Knees, set in Cape Breton at in the first half of the 20th century, tells the story of Materia, Kathleen, Mercedes, Frances, and Lily - i.e. all the women of the Piper family. Each woman has a voice, a distinct history, a distinct outlook on life - and a distinct fate. So, really this is a novel with five main characters - not to mention James, who dwells at the centre of all their lives.This book has so many layers that it was easy to be sucked into the world of the Pipers. But it is not a comfortable place. Far from it, it is a world full of harshness, brutality, and abuse, where each of the characters is trying to escape the confines of what holds them. Be it religion, loyalty, or something else - each character has their own form of imprisonment. \"God did not put me on this earth to stand by while my sister Frances is killed. Beaten is one thing. Wrongly touched is one thing. Stabbed with a bayonet is another. Push. Be strong enough to carry the burden of sin that goes with doing the right thing. There is only one saint in this family and I\u2019m not it. God has made Mercedes a judge. No one loves you for that. Not like a crippled child who\u2019s prone to visions. Whom Mercedes prizes. Not like a fallen woman who makes people laugh. Whom Mercedes loves.\"When reading some of the reviews, the aspect that I have picked up on most is that people have read this because it was an Oprah bookclub read. I am usually hesitant to follow up hyped up books, but sometimes, just sometimes, they are a exactly the type of book that will work their way into your soul.Fall on Your Knees is a perfectly constructed family saga, but it is also more than this. It is a beautifully sketched insight into the human condition. Mercedes is neither a saint nor a sinner. She is somewhere in between. She is why purgatory was invented."}, {"userName": "Shawna Williams", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2706804-shawna-williams", "userReview": "Actually, I give this sort of a three b/c the author's style was oddly skillful, as a story though, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Parts of the books were intriguing, other parts disturbing -- but given the subject matter I see no way around that; and yet, I can't quite get past it either.Frankly I'm just really conflicted. The writing style was definitely interesting. Choppy, metaphoric, sensational; the author was very effective in putting me inside the characters' heads. I admire her ability, but sometimes I wanted out b/c it was such a dreadful place to be.The father was a dispicable man, and there is no getting around that. The forgiveness between him and Frances at the end was somewhat redeeming -- sort of. The way Frances sent Lilly out into the world was weird. And the ending was unsatisfying regarding every character, except for Frances's son.Hmm...I think I'll be puzzling over this one for awhile, and maybe that was the author's goal.

I read Fall on Your Knee second and had that wonderful enjoyment of a second shot of a writer who you liked so much the first time you didn't think you could have that pleasure again. Not only was Fall On Your Knees similarly satisfying, but it was uniquely satisfying for AMM's ability to create a nearly perfect gothic novel, along with all her other amazing traits.

In DROWNING RUTH, the whole idea of a mentally-ill and controlling aunt (Amanda) ruining the life of her little niece (Ruth) after the girl's mother (Mathilda) mysteriously fell through the ice and drowned one cold winter eve was merely depressing; in FALL ON YOUR KNEES, however,the pervading theme of incest was more than distressing, it was just downright gross (and this is from an open-minded reader NOT easily shocked or bothered by sexual content!) Although I am always interested in reading books that deal with sensitive and even shocking topics (sometimes this makes a book more interesting!), I just don't find a need to experience incest in such poetic prose!There's one thing I don't get - in the description on the back cover, the story is called \"menacingly dark and hilariously funny\" and it is also called \"darkly humorous\".

I had this book on my shelf for over three years before attempting to read it, wondering how the author would sustain my interest over its 560-plus pages. And, once making the bold attempt to finally pick-up the book, I had difficulty putting it down at times.The novel is visual, reminiscent of a screenplay. MacDonald uses a variety of techniques to hook the reader: the rapid mixing of tenses and point-of-view, anchoring the story along pivotal events and replaying those scenes from different vantage points like different camera angles applied for the same screen shot, hiding information in scenes and gradually revealing more clues in subsequent takes of the same scene, using combinations of journal, memory, snappy and irreverent dialogue and tight unconventional narrative that focuses on visual imagery rather than on syntactical propriety - yes, a masterful performance for a first novel, and great learning for emerging novelists.This story has a resemblance to the King Lear tale but is not as obvious as in recent re-takes such as Jane Smiley's \"A Thousand Acres\". The patriarch, James Piper, marries a Lebanese child-bride and begets daughters, some whose mothers are unclear until the end. There is Kathleen the budding opera singer, Frances the evil one, Mercedes the pious one, and the crippled Lilly the saint. Incest is at the core, which hobbles and fractures the family over a time horizon spanning the dawn of the twentieth century to the 1950'sPivotal events such as Kathleen's tragic birthing of twins and its series of catastrophic aftershocks, Frances' shooting and the events that precede and follow, the unravelling of what happened to Kathleen in New York - are all launching points to move the story forward and grip the reader in a non-stop read.The four sisters emerge gradually from their childhood as the indistinguishable offspring of James Piper, into fully flushed characters with different personalities and histories over the time span of this novel. Unfortunately, Momma, or Materia their Lebanese mother, gets no accolades for the girls' destiny, apart from a few Arabic words they banter around, and the occasional Middle Eastern dish they prepare for James. Daddy, in his twisted, well meaning way, gets all the credit for the disasters that befell their lives.

Rose che ad un certo punto di questo libro, quasi alla fine, devo dire, conoscerete, dice una cosa che mi ha colpita ma con la quale posso solo parzialmente dichiararmi d' accordo:  \"Non sono una compositrice. Metto insieme delle note sul momento.\" Io le ho detto che questo si chiama comporre, ma lei ha ribattuto che non scrive mai la musica. Ogni volta \u00e8 diversa. \"Allora la scriva\" e lei \"No\" \"Perch\u00e9\" ho chiesto.\"Perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec uccidi l' uccello\" fa lei.Rose ha ragione, per un certo verso, non si pu\u00f2 mai replicare la magia di un singolo momento in musica, per quanto tu possa riascoltare sempre e sempre la stessa canzone, ogni secondo che passa in ogni riascolto avr\u00e0 una valenza diversa.Per\u00f2, appunto per questo, anche se la musica \u00e8 sempre quella, sempre la stessa successione di note, cambia la maniera in cui \"ci veste\". E cosa \u00e8 questo se non un particolare?La stessa cosa dicasi per le storie, potrei dire che questa \u00e8 una delle tante saghe familiari al mondo, da Marquez a Irving passando per la Ginzburg facendo una capatina anche per Eugenides. Potrei dirlo, ma quanti particolari trascurerei e quanta magia gli toglierei. Magia, che nelle saghe famigliari c'\u00e8 sempre, perch\u00e9 cosa \u00e8 che ci consente di stare ancora insieme senza farci fuori se non un pizzico di un particolare tipo di magia?Perdetevici dentro, nei vostri momenti scandalizzati, impietosi, pietosi, felici, simpatizzanti e non, e buona lettura.Sono proprio curiosa di sapere per chi simpatizzerete. Lei dice che la musica \u00e8 gi\u00e0 nell\u2019 aria e sta a noi aprirle un accesso nel nostro mondo per poterla ascoltare . Come se il mondo fosse pieno di musica che non riusciamo a sentire \u201ca orecchio nudo\u201d. Cos\u00ec oggi a lezione ho pensato: d\u2019 accordo, la canzone come andrebbe cantata sta scintillante intorno a me come aria nel deserto, io non devo fare altro che accoglierla. Allora ho chiuso gli occhi e mi sono aperta lasciando che la canzone mi attraversasse e ho pensato: \u201c nom cantarla, liberala\u201d. Quando ho finito, il kaiser ha annuito. Ho guardato Rose, che ha rivolto un minuscolo sorriso ai tasti."}, {"userName": "Serena..

[Resistete ad una frase del genere!!]Credo che il titolo originale sia molto pi\u00f9 evocativo e crudele: Fall on your knees . Ma non c'\u00e8 problema, perch\u00e9 il libro \u00e8 abbastanza evocativo e crudele di per s\u00e8. Sfido chiunque a leggere questo libro e non venire assalito da una valanga di sentimenti contrastanti: piet\u00e0, odio, amore, tenerezza, disperazione, impotenza.E' un libro crudo e doloroso, eppure in grado di tenerti l\u00ec incollato alle pagine, con un desiderio quasi perverso di andare avanti e scoprire quali altre disgrazie aspettino la famiglia Piper: perch\u00e8 ad ogni pagina c'\u00e8 un elemento che ti fa piangere il cuore.Tutto inizia con la fuga d'amore di James, 18 anni, e Materia, 13, gi\u00e0 promessa in sposa ad un altro uomo. La famiglia di Materia non li perdoner\u00e0 tanto facilmente, anzi: il padre la maledice e la disereda.La maledizione ha effetto: Il marito si si pente di averla sposata, si vergogna a farsi vedere in giro con lei e quando nasce Kathleen, sua pupilla, non la tocca nemmeno pi\u00f9.I drammi della famiglia non finiscono: un parto difficile, la morte di Kathleen per parto, il suicidio di Materia perch\u00e9 ha peccato: ha salvato i due bambini e non Kathleen (Che in cuor suo, non \u00e8 mai riuscita ad amare); il maldestro tentativo di una bimba di sei anni di battezzare i nipotini, la stessa bambina che, cresciuta, \u00e8 incapace di farsi amare e con tutta probabilit\u00e0, di amare a sua volta. (Per\u00f2 la stimo: le sue bambole hanno dei nomi assurdi: Scarlattina, Rose Difterite, i marinai gemelli Tifo e TBC Vedetta, Vaiolo, La Spagnola e Colera La France).Mercedes \u00e8 una bambina stupenda: credo di non aver mai provato tanta tenerezza e amore per nessun personaggio letterario. L'adotterei, se fosse possibile.A 7 anni, quando la mamma si suicida, il padre le affida la cura della sorellina (6 anni) e della nipotina (appena nata), e si trova a crescere improvvisamente, senza l'aiuto di nessuno. Si fa carico delle sorelle, del padre (Che cerca sempre di soddisfare in un modo cos\u00ec commovente che ci sarebbe da piangere), della casa e dei veterani della guerra. Continuando ovviamente ad andare a scuola. Ha una pazienza e una bont\u00e0 infinite, roba che Gandhi dovrebbe solo che prendere lezioni.Purtroppo lo stile della MacDonal non \u00e8 quello che si dice perfetto: passa dal passato al presente, passando dalla terza alla prima persona in modo a volte confusionario.. A volte poi i dialoghi non sono nemmeno virgolettati.Ma per il grande impatto che d\u00e0 la storia, ad Ann-Marie si perdona tutto.La V stellina \u00e8 perch\u00e9 l'intera vicenda si svolge nel mio amato Canada, e pi\u00f9 precisamente nella Nova Scotia, dove ho passato 6 mesi della mia vita.. Insomma, l'ho sentito super vicino. :)Ah, la V stellina \u00e8 anche per il fatto che la famiglia di Materia ha origine arabe, dal Libano, pi\u00f9 precisamente, e quindi nel testo sono frequenti frasi in arabo.. Ho molto apprezzato, anche se ne ho capite la met\u00e0!!"}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873788-leanne", "userReview": "Where do I even start with this one? This is heavy, heavy stuff, full to the brim with family secrets. And some of these are some pretty hardcore secrets. When asked by a co-worker what I was reading lately, I barely knew what to say - \"Well, this book about a family, and their gross father, and there's a lot of incest...\" But while there is definitely a very strong undercurrent of incesty feelings and behavior running through the entire novel, there is much more to it.It's hard to give a high level summary of the plot without diving into all of the intricacies. Basically, it's a family saga about 4 sisters and their father living in Cape Breton that spans maybe 30-40 years (I'm too lazy to officially work out the timeline in my head!) There are several main events that you learn about slowly, by jumping back and forth in time until all of the mysteries are finally revealed. This storytelling device works well here - it never feels disjointed, and makes it more exciting (as well as, admittedly, icky).None of the (main) characters are particularly likeable. They all have some redeeming qualities - Frances is bright and vivacious and fun before her rebellious behavior just becomes over the top, Mercedes really is just trying to take care of her family, even as she comes off as overly pious and condescending, and Lily is altogether innocent, but she does certain things that make you want to strangle her. Even Materia, who is for the most part a victim forced into a strange and vaguely sadistic marriage at the age of 12, didn't elicit full sympathy from me. Often, not connecting with any of the characters on a personal level ruins a book for me, but in this case I was completely fascinated. Having had a very normal childhood with very normal parents and a sister, reading about a family like this was compelling and satisfyingly twisted.To me, this book was dark and sad, but there was a beautiful quality to it too. It wasn't necessarily the best time for me to read it, as the weather is finally becoming sunny and gorgeous - I feel this type of sordid book is more suited for the dark depths of winter. The prose is hazy and wistful and sad, and it's just such a good story. I'm sorry that it took me so long to become aware of this book and to pick it up, and at 584 pages it was an effort, but it was well, well worth it."}, {"userName": "Scooping it Up", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2726439-scooping-it-up", "userReview": "I cannot recommend this book. I actually threw it away after finishing it.This tells you a few things. 1) The writing was so good and compelling and addicting it made it difficult for me to stop reading, despite my issues with it. 2) I didn't want anyone else to read it, so I didn't give it away or sell it. How's that for hypocritical and childish?There were some sexual images, specifically incest, that I could not shake from my brain for several days. I kept replaying the scenes over and over and over again. It really bothered me.I don't like artsy descriptions of horrible perversion. One part of this book that I LOVED was in a marital-infidelity situation. The husband was systematically, purposefully seduced by a rather messed-up younger woman. He was a good man, a good father, and found himself in a very bad situation. Afterwards, he ran straight to his wife and told her. He was repentent, miserable. She instantly forgave him. She knew it would never happen again. And it didn't. It was a very cool concept that their marriage, their family was bigger than a moment of weakness. What he did was horrible. But to her, it wasn't horrible enough to lose what they had. I really admired this idea. It's not how we look at marriage very much today and it was refreshing. I enjoyed her writing style, obviously I was sucked in enough to read through it, but my heart was really dark and cloudy for a few days after reading it.

I'm going to think on my second rating a bit more, but I can tell you that this was a very different read this time. I don't know that I liked it as much - although I recognize the mastery of its writing and characterization, and the amazing imagination behind the story. And I love how Cape Breton it was. But it was also gruelling and painful; it was long and sloggy at the 2/3rds to 4/5ths mark. And of course, having read it, the big reveal at the end was not the shocker it was on first read.

I'll admit that I am always a bit of a night owl but even I don't stay up that late often. However I just couldn't put this book down. As the book wraps up it just pulls you in like passing a bad car accident. You know it's going to be disturbing and hard to watch but you can't look away.Fall On Your Knees (Oprah #45)The book follows the Piper family from the late 1890's through several generations of increasingly disturbed individuals. In the beginning of the book James Piper is a piano tuner who ends up running away with Materia Mahmoud, the daughter of one of his clients. Oh, did I mention that Materia is a mere 12 going on 13 at the time? What comes from their union is the stuff that episodes of Maury Povich are made of. Incest, lies, deception, secrets, and more drama than you can shake a stick at. James is ambitious, self righteous and a bit of a pedophile. His wife Materia is simple, a little childish and resentful of the path her life has taken.They have three daughters as different as can be. Kathleen, the oldest and the apple of daddy's eye who has an operatic voice of an angel and she knows it. Frances, the wild child and Mercedes, who is very pious and good and who tries desperately to keep her family in line and together but she ends up being sucked into the depravity too, by the end of the book.I didn't think I would like this book at first. None of the main characters are like-able. In fact, most of the smaller characters are unlike-able as well. These are deeply flawed individuals, making horrible choice after horrible choice and yet I became invested in their story.Like a bad talk show, the book is filled with many OMG and WTF moments and even a few that left me asking \"Wait....WHAT?\" as I frantically read on to see what was going to happen next.Of course I don't get my answers till much later in the book. Ann-Marie MacDonald often reveals major events early but doesn't show the journey that led to those events until much later. The point of view shifts often and you may think you know the story as you read it from one POV, you find that you were very mistaken as the same events is retold through a different character. It kept me guessing and as I finished the book I realized that all was definitely not as it seemed.It was an extremely dark book, I disliked all the characters and there are very few happy moments but I ended up loving it."}, {"userName": "CaseyTheCanadianLesbrarian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian", "userReview": "What to say about this devastating masterpiece? It's the 2nd time I've read it, and while it was hard to read the 1st time, I think re-reading is perhaps worse, because I knew the horrible thing that was coming (incest/rape). I don't really know how Ann-Marie MacDonald writes beautifully about such dark things, telling the intergenerational story of this fucked up family.

I loved it. In fact its one of my favorite books of all time. Its dark and deep but beautiful. The book is actually based in the town I grew up in so it was interesting to read about the town I grew up in only during the setting of the book. It was wonderful to read about the church I grew up in, my grandmothers church and later, the church I married my husband in. The book being set in Cape Breton was what grabbed my attention but the story dragged me in and kept a death grip on me til I finished it. The first time I read it, I actually stayed up all night to finish it. This book is not for the light at heart. If you don't take any enjoyment from stories that talk about incest or other related but depressing topics, then this book is not for you. If you are looking for a happily ever after, go find something else. This isn't a fluffy and happy novel.
