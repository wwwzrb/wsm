This book was such a step up from the first in my opinion, mainly because most of the issues I had with The Enemy were rectified in The Dead.This book is set a year before the events in The Enemy with a different set of characters, and I appreciated that because the whole zombie situation hadn't been happening as long. There are even a couple of people who hadn't yet turned. While it still hasn't explained what caused it, it was nice to have a bit of insight into the earlier days.The pacing was still fast and furious (no, not a film about cars) but rather than the POV constantly changing without a warning, there were little breaks between paragraphs if it changed making it much easier to keep track. It also wasn't told from too many perspectives - mainly just the two friends Jack and Ed, with the occasional other character thrown in. The thing that I realised though, is that these minor characters will probably return in other books. I'm basing that hypothesis solely on the appearance of some characters from The Enemy in this book.The thing that almost broke me was when someone was dying...the way it was written was beautiful and it felt way too real like I was there in the room. There was more character growth in this book too, mainly Ed who goes on one hell of a journey.I feel like this review is so unorganised and makes no sense whatsoever, but basically I loved this book so so much. It is tense and addictive and gripping and surprising and so many more positive words.

Props to Charlie Higson."}, {"userName": "Clair", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333119-clair", "userReview": "Charlie Higson is a pretty amazing writer, you guys. He may be writing for teenage boys who love computer games and want constant action in their books, but man, do I love his writing. It's so wonderfully short and snappy, and... oh, man. He's really good at characterisation too and had me damn near on the verge of tears or gasping at my copy at certain parts. Excuse me for a moment while I go flap my hands and squee.I'll try my best to review without getting too excited, but basically, the ending of this book made me go just as loopy with fangirl fervour as when I finished Monsters of Men. (Minus the flood of tears, though.) And that's a very high compliment.The Dead is the second book in Charlie Higson's The Enemy series, about kids and teenagers trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic London, with every adult or older teen having been turned into a zombie. Not green, wide-eyed infected people who shuffle around the city going: \u201cBraiiiins.\u201d No, think the zombies from Left 4 Dead. If you accidentally bump into a car and set off its alarm, you are going to get killed in a matter of moments, my friend. The zombies in The Enemy are actually, as it is revealed in this book, super-efficient hunters. The disease itself (shown to us by one of the more likeable older kids actually succumbing to the sickness, sob sob) makes it painful for the zombies to be out in daylight, and makes them gradually lose every memory and every bit of individuality until they are just working off their instincts, hunting, trapping, and killing their prey. Their symptoms, however seem to recede when they eat the flesh of the uninfected, in this case, the children who are desperately trying to survive.The book begins at an all-boys boarding school, in which the teachers have become infected and are trying to pick off the students. Some of the boys are swept up in a religious fervour, believing that the disease is an act of God, and creating their own little cult, refusing to be swayed by logic and demanding to be taken to the places promised to them by 'the Lamb'. The majority of the boys, however, think it would be much more sensible to go out into the countryside and establish a farming commune. Unfortunately, they are told by an uninfected coach driver that everyone tried to do that when the virus hit. \"Everyone's had the same idea as you - go back to nature, live off the land. They've watched too many Bear Grylls programmes on telly. And what happens? They've all wound up in the great outdoors with everyone else. City types. Useless. Didn't know one end of a cow from another. It's all right one bloke and his dog living off the land - not millions of blokes, and their wives and kids and hamsters.\"Unfortunately, all adults eventually get infected by this illness, and... oh man, there is no creepier scene than when Greg, the coach driver, hugs his son close to him at night as the sickness is starting to really get to him, and kills Liam by constricting his breathing.From then on, it's the kids trying to get to safety, or talking about how they're going to survive, and... oh God, man. Charlie Higson is so good at making you care for these kids. They're funny, a little bit na\u00efve, and most of all, everyone is really likeable. Even when they do make stupid mistakes, they are just kids, so you can't really blame them too much for not thinking beyond the simplest option to a dilemma. Still, it works really well for those nail-biting moments. I almost dropped my iPad on the bus floor at one particularly shocking revelation, so yeah. It's that good.Another thing Charlie Higson is really good at? Grossing you out. I think the man should take up a side job as a dietitian or something. Normally, I read with something to eat by my side. I can't do that with these books. My stomach just churns too much. And this coming from a girl who's normally quite non-plussed by gore!Greg belched, causing a big brown bubble to form between his lips. It burst, filling the coach with a foul stench. He wiped his mouth and then spat a gobbet of rubbery mucus against a window, where it slowly crawled down like a fat yellow slug. (40%)He rubbed his neck. It was ringed with boils, like a horrible shiny yellow scarf. (59%)...A cascade of dead bodies tumbled down from one of the piles directly into their path.They had no choice. They would have to climb over them.They tried, but it was like wading through deep mud. The bodies were so soft they gave way beneath their feet and the boys found themselves treading in shredded skin and innards. (64%)His body felt hot and damp. His breath came straight from an abattoir. He was breathing through his mouth, and pink-flecked saliva foamed at his lips. (72%)This book was absolutely excellent. Paced perfectly, with wonderful characters who will have you screaming: \u201cIT'S A TRAP!\u201d like Admiral Ackbar, virtually no slowing-down of the plot, and some great psychological questions to ponder over, The Dead deserves nothing less than 5/5 stars.(This review is also available on my blog: http://book-wyrm.blogspot.co.uk/2013/...)"}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "His descriptions are so gory and detailed.

I've come across some astoundingly good stories in the last few months. This week I'm looking at one of the most brutal: The Dead, by Charlie Higson.The basic premise of the book is that only children under the age of fourteen survive a disease which turns everyone else into flesh-hungry maniacs who would be best described as Zombies, although they aren't dead.It is left to the children to survive and try to rebuild as much as they can. The book follows a group of young boys at a school where their teachers have turned on them. It is interesting to follow their struggle and I found myself feeling all of their pent-up, edgy frustrations with their broken world. We journey with them as they escape their school into the nightmarish streets of London, where all hell awaits them.I don't want to give away too much of the plot but I'll say it's gripping stuff! What is so spectacular about this book is how very grim it is. Higson pulls no punches with his writing and I love that he respects the YA audience enough to be honestly dark with themIn the book, fathers kill sons, parents eat the flesh of their children, the \"Sickos\" gnaw at their own flesh in efforts to get to the more tasty treat of young human flesh. Beyond the sickness, we see the fragile line of sanity which the boys walk as they are forced to kill, cheat, confront the seemingly insane ravings of a boy \"prophet\" and make terrible decisions, all in order to survive.The story...the sickness... begins with a video posted on youtube. The video of \"The Scared Kid\".I thoroughly recommend this book, which is also, by the way, the prequel to The Enemy, another amazing read!Lx"}, {"userName": "\u2623Lynn\u2623", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7101656-lynn", "userReview": "Second read 4.5 starsThis was so much better the second time around!

The zombies were described so vividly, I had to check behind me- just in case. The characters were extremely lovable, which ended up being a problem for me. I got attached to them, and of course the nice children get killed off but the religious maniac stays. Sometimes the deaths happened so fast it took me a bit to register why a character was crying, then I realized, \"Oh. His best friend just died.\"This was a nonstop adrenaline rollercoaster. I have a bad habit of reading fast, almost to the point where I'm skimming the page, when things get exciting. I'm a sucker for a good fight scene. Of course, people die in the process, but sometimes I'm relieved they're gone if they were annoying characters. At one point in the story, the author specifically wrote that a zombie was stalking the children, but the attack was placed in just the right moment and striked when I had just let my guard down. Usually when I read fast, I miss some things and I have to go back and reread which kills the moment for me. This isn't the book's fault, it's more of a \"Me Thing\" than anything else.But the ending was really something. It was beautiful and connected with the ending of the previous book. In the previous book, two characters got rescued, and that first book was about the children who got rescued. This book was about the rescuers' background. I felt like crying at the end since everything now made so much sense, but I figured it wasn't something to cry over and decided against it. I wanted to though, since it all came together in the most heart-wrenching and beautiful way. I instead just sat and stared into space for what seemed like forever until I had time to fully register everything. If I could rate this book more than 5 stars, I would without hesitation. However I'm limited, but I suppose it's for the best since Goodreads would have some problems to fix because of how many stars I would rate books."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5663034-k", "userReview": "22/4/2016Things I expected rereading this: everyone dies, extreme amounts of grossness.Things I did not expect: to tear up over one character's ending. I feel like this is a series that very much benefits from being read back to back. Yes, this is a prequel. But it's a prequel that makes a hell of a lot more sense if you read it fairly soon after reading the first one so that all the little details connecting the two really stand out. 28/1/2015I was a little bit terrified of reading this, because zombies are totally my squick and reading The Enemy gave me horrifying nightmares. I'm not sure if it's that I knew what to expect or if this was less gory/violent than The Enemy, but while I had occasional moments of \"OH GOD WHY EW\", there was never that gut-wrenching sense of fear that came with the first book in the series. This is, to all intents and purposes, a prequel. It features (as far as I remember) none of the characters that we met in the first book, and starts out a year before the events of The Enemy. I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed this, and the sneaky little hints of plot points that link into the first book. The kids in this book were older than many of those in the first book, with many of them in their early teens. So that made a pleasant change from reading about nine year olds dying horrifically. But it also meant that the book reminded me a lot of Michael Grant's Gone series. It's brutal and occasionally horrifying and if pus grosses you out, you really shouldn't read this book because there's a disturbing amount of pus involved. And, just like I said last time, don't get attached to anyone. Ever. Because they will probably get eaten by zombies."}, {"userName": "Alex - coffeeloving_bookoholic", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58095405-alex---coffeeloving-bookoholic", "userReview": "The end was soooooo good!

ZOMBIE GIFS AHEADThis series literally has me shook I can't believe I read these when I was little they are so violent ??? like SO violent ? It's basically the book version of The Walking Dead, except only adults become zombies. Which means the world is now run by 15 year olds who are trying not to get eaten by the adult zombies. Oh, also the zombies are smart, and they make traps and ambushes for the kids ,,,, its fuckin intense and TRUST I would be dead in this world I would be so dead  (actually I'd be a zombie bc I'm over 15 but SHUT UP I would somehow not get the sickness ok I hate adult life) THE DEAD offers a differing story of the events in THE ENEMY, explaining the story of the London Tower kids and how they established themselves following the apocalypse. and hoNESTLY the kids from the London Tower are sooo much more interesting then the Waitrose kids. I like how THE DEAD starts to develop the storyline outside of just ZOMBIES and killing. The addition of Matt, Archie and The Acolytes was really interesting!! I remembered alot of this storyline from when I first read these books but I liked to explore that since I'm pretty sure it's going to become more important later. I really enjoyed the characters in THE DEAD and thought they were more realistic and interesting. I liked Jack and Ed's dynamic and thought theirs was a pre realistic portrayal of things tbh. I liked that they weren't always the best of friends ahaha.

In this book it begins one year earlier than the first book. A disease has struck every one of the age of sixteen. The adults are either decomposing or dead zombie like creatures. In the beginning it starts in a boarding school, where all of the teachers have gotten infected. They then decide they need to leave if they\u2019re going to survive any longer. A few kids survive and travel by bus into the city. The bus driver Greg is an adult who has no gotten the disease yet. However after a few days on the bus he begins to show the signs of the disease. The kids decide they need to escape the bus, and they end up at the Imperial War Museum. A huge fire in South London Force them out, and they end up in The Tower of London. In this book I liked the author\u2019s writing style. Higson lets you see the perspective of every character. He usually changes the characters every chapter. It is very easy to understand. At the end of the book he is very good at leaving cliff hangers. He also doesn\u2019t over do the description, and I really like that because just reading the description of a character gets very boring. This book reminds me of the T.V. show \u201cThe Waling Dead\u201d because they are trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. Yet there are many differenced such as in the book all of the people sixteen and up get sick, and in the show people of any age can get sick. Overall I find this series very interesting. I never thought I would read anything like this, but once I picked up the first book I couldn\u2019t put it down. I liked this book because when I was reading I felt as if I could step out of reality, and when I put it down it was back to normal. Higson really knows how to suck a reader into the world of his books. I would recommend this book to really anyone because it\u2019s suitable for anyone."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878068-angela", "userReview": "Thoroughly enjoyable sequel to Higson's The Enemy. This time the story is told from the perspective of a different set of surviving kids (who were also featured in the first book, albeit briefly) and set a year before the events in the first book, so technically this is a prequel.If I'm honest, I think I preferred this book to the first one. The characters were all great and the world-building was fun to read, and rather terrifying in parts. I abhorred Greg from the instant he appeared and I was pleasantly surprised to find out who he becomes. The one thing that does annoy me about Higson however is that he writes about certain characters indepth and as a reader you really start to emphasise with them and then BAM! they're killed off! I really should have learned my lesson about this from the first book but I didn't. It's a good technique to use as it really makes you wonder who will survive and who won't; there is no set protagonist or 'hero' so makes it all the more interesting to read.Excellent sequel/prequel and after checking the library catalogue I am very happy to discover the rest of the series is available so that has made me happy."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104823-kate", "userReview": "I read this ARC via Netgalley.A year before the events of The Enemy, the grown-ups are just starting to get sick and turn into flesh-eating monsters. The first most people hear of this zombie plague is an online video that some believed at first to be a joke. A band of students are holed up at their all-boys private school until it becomes clear that they are never going to be able to keep the infected teachers at bay. They plan to leave and find someplace safer, along the way rescuing the daughter of the French teacher, Frederique, and her cat. The group is getting picked off one by one and are nearly overwhelmed when a bus rolls up. The driver is a grown-up, but he doesn't seem to be infected... at first. As the boys get to know Frederique and the three snotty girls in the back seat, the zombies keep coming and only courage and luck will keep them alive.I liked the cast of characters and how this book follows one core group around rather than killing off who I thought was the main character halfway through (ahem, as in The Enemy). There's Jack, the leader; Ed, his somewhat cowardly right-hand man; Kwanele, the rich fashion-obsessed student; Chris, the bookworm; Wiki, the know-it-all. The threesome of Mean Girls added a strange level of irony to the situations (like Courtney, who always adds that every place anyone mentions is a \"dump\"). I liked seeing the precursor to the boys who hold down the Tower of London, and the other group that becomes the group of kids ruling at Buckingham Palace. I even enjoyed the glimpses into the minds of two of the \"sickos\" - the butcher, and the zombie they named \"Pez.\" And of course the little glimpse of Sam!This prequel was packed with action and a little more character development than The Enemy (see what happens when you keep some of those characters alive through the entire book?).

Suddenly you have to get to know a whole group of characters again and you are reintroduced to the world only from a different perspective.Luckily Mr Higson is a FANTASTIC writer and it is not too long before you are rooting for an entirely new set of people and reading in fear and wonder at the tale which slowly reveals itself. The is much to enjoy in these books. A darkness which really pushes at the boundaries of the age, sharply observed and well written characters with several narratives that slowly intertwine. The characters are rounded and its odd that the zombies are not always without some sympathy. There are a number of really awful moments in the book and at one stage the internal clock is pushed forward a lot further than I expected it to be but these are minor quibbles at best.

And sad bits, meaning don't get too attached to anyone!"}, {"userName": "15SaltmerJ Saltmer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68655171-15saltmerj-saltmer", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this book as it was very exciting at many moment. I definitely recommend that people who have read the first book go on to read this one. However, I feel that at a few moments the book was slightly to slow and it wasn't progressing very much. Overall this was a really enjoyable book to read with multiple cliff hangers and tense moments."}, {"userName": "Zach E", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70643816-zach-e", "userReview": "I thought this book was much better than the first in the trilogy. I do prefer lots of explosions and fighting, and I think this book did not under do it or overdo it. Puts real-life scenarios in a book of fantasy. Loved the first book and I love the \u00a8prequel\u00a8.(Yes it is a prequel to book one) It was interesting how it tied in at the end. This book was all about tying up loose ends and gave us the backstory for the characters in the next book."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19982773-julia", "userReview": "\"The Dead\" is a great book to read if you're interest in action, and science fiction. More of a young adult novel, this book goes to great lengths in order to describe a world where everyone over sixteen has turned into a rotting, boil covered monster- and kids run about the streets desperate to survive. The circumstances of this story arise when a mysterious illness sweeps all across London- as well as other parts of the world- and the only food that keeps these diseased creatures alive is the meat of children. Taking place one year prior to the first book in the series, the main characters of The Dead are a group of adolescent boys escaping from their old private school, is who the book follows.  Charlie Higson adds suspense and thrill to this intricate read. Characters are killed off at the blink of an eye, showing readers the realism and intensity that the book entails. The main thing I adored about this book was the way the author spread information among the characters. When one character told a lie, the information spread quickly and the truth was quickly brought to light. I enjoyed that aspect of the writing of this novel because it helps the story line advance farther along than it would have if small conflicts stretched their lifespan across the entire book.  There's a great use of diction and syntax all through The Dead. Higson uses short and crisp sentences to snap at the reader's attention and make sure they're aware if the most obvious and important aspects if the story. Figurative language is used to relate the novel in ways the audience can more easily understand. A good example would be a description of a \"sicko\" (an adult after they'd been consumed with illness.) Higson talks about pus dripping, boil covered monsters who often times are missing several limbs. The gore and pure mess of detail allows the reader to feel as the characters of the book feel by the sight- sickened, disgusted. That these things that used to be people, some of whom they previously knew before the disaster- have now turned into disgusting monsters who only think about where they can find their next child meal.  It's an interesting concept how the book actually takes place a year before the first book- also the face that this sequel focused on a whole new group of kids trying to escape the same bad situations. It sort of annoyed me in the beginning how my favorite heroes had been left in the dark the whole novel as the story continued on, all harsh feelings were forgotten as I allowed myself to be sucked into another land of the dead. I'd recommend this book and book series to anyone who enjoys reading. Whether you like romance, science, fiction, of adult novels- this book series has something in it that everyone can enjoy, with still a multitude of more books to come in the series."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26547771-martin", "userReview": "The second book in Charlie Higson\u2019s The Enemy series, Higson has opted for a none-linear approach to this series and this time we follow a completely separate group of youngsters as they try to survive in the world filled with ravenous, kid-hungry adults. Set two years before the occurrences of the first book, during a time when it seems the world is just beginning to experience the true and horrific nature of the disease that has wiped out or transformed the adult population. We follow a group of boys, initially holding out at their boarding school fighting off hordes of teachers afflicted by the disease. The group has a mixture of characters that you would be familiar with in any school setting from jocks, geeks and misfits each with their own personalities, strengths, skills and way of dealing with the horrors at hand. The two characters at the forefront of the story are Jack and Ed, best friends but both with completely different approaches to dealing with what they are faced with. Jack, on one hand is a fighter, whereas Ed isn\u2019t able to bring himself to do any harm to the once protective, now homicidal, vile, puss and boil covered adults. In this story the kids do find some security in the form of Greg, an adult who is unaffected by the disease and somewhat more organised, laden with supplies and in possession of a vehicle. Eventually, due to shocking and horrific circumstances the children must separate from Greg and this leads them to the safety of the Imperial War Museum. Under the reign of Jordan Hordern the group do experience some luck but as always Higson is able to snatch this sense of security away with the introduction of other dangers.Throughout the story the relationships develop between all the characters. Jack and Ed\u2019s relationship is tested throughout and it\u2019s great to see new relationships form. It\u2019s hard not to become attached to the group and hope for their survival, every individual has their own unique personality and dialogue all of which feel realistic. Another aspect of this book that added to the intrigue was the recognisable characters that we were introduced to in The Enemy, we are reintroduced to David King before he occupies Buckingham palace. As with the first book it was also filled with plenty of action and nail biting suspense. I\u2019ve become used to the idea that nobody is safe in Higson\u2019s series and this had me glued to each page with a sense of trepidation. Action scenes were quick and brutal as well as gruesomely detailed and gore filled. This is a must read for any zombie fan, the Enemy series is great and I can\u2019t wait to see how the series concludes."}], "description": "The Dead is the second book in Charlie Higson's jaw-dropping zombie horror series for teens.Everyone over the age of fourteen has succumbed to a deadly zombie virus and now the kids must keep themselves alive.
