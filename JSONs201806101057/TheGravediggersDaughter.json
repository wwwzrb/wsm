I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)So what's the dark fear that lies in the inner heart of all erudite nerds? Namely this -- that no matter how educated, intelligent or well-read you are, there are always going to be a certain amount of very well-known authors you have never read at all, not even one single page of, and that at any moment this fact might be discovered by your fellow erudite nerds. Just take me, for example, who can count among completely unread authors such stalwarts as (deep breath, Jason, deep breath) Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Norman Mailer, Augusten Burroughs, Dave Eggers, and dozens more embarrassing admissions. So needless to say that I was excited to recently come across the latest novel by Joyce Carol Oates at my local library, 2007's The Gravedigger's Daughter, because Oates is yet another of these classic \"everyone has read at least one book by her\" authors who I haven't read myself; and that's apparently a shame, according to my fellow book-loving geeks, given that Oates (a lit professor at Princeton) has been a multiple nominee over the years of the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, PEN/Faulkner Award and Orange Prize, not to mention the actual winner of an NBA (in 1970), a Stoker Award and a dozen other accolades. And this is to say nothing of The Gravedigger's Daughter in particular, which made the New York Times' \"10 Most Notable Books of the Year\" list last year; and of course all of this is small potatoes compared to the greatest achievement of Oates' entire career so far, making it into the Revered And Blessed Oprah's Book Club Hallowed Be Her Name Amen.So I checked it out and sat down a couple of weeks ago to read it; and then about a week later, found myself finally giving up on it for good around page 250 or so (or roughly halfway through), after two days of literally dreading the idea of even physically picking the book up again. So what happened? Well, to answer that, maybe it would be better for me to ask you a series of questions, questions I've been starting to wonder more and more about the longer CCLaP has been open. Ready?--Why is it that almost all novels revered by the academic community principally feature characters who are constantly in a state of being slightly miserable? And not miserable as in \"interesting\" miserable, but miserable as in \"that whiny professor in the corner of the room who ruins every godd-mn party they're invited to\" miserable?--Why is it that almost all award-winning novels go way out of their way, deliberately out of their way, to show off what pretty language that author knows, completely removing the reader from the natural pace and rhythm of the story itself? Why can no academically revered novel simply let the reader get lost in the actual story, which is the entire point of a novel even existing?*--Why is it that academes are so fascinated by mediocre EveryPeople living in bland surroundings, who do nothing with their unremarkable lives and yet somehow still manage to make a whole series of terrible life decisions? Why do so many people in the academic community think that this makes for fascinating literature, and why do they think we should sympathize or even care about such oblivious, socially retarded chumps?It's the great mystery of the arts, I'm beginning to understand, as CCLaP has me reading academically-revered award-winning novels on a regular basis for the first time in my life; that the exact novels most lauded by this community are the very ones least fitting the definition of an entertaining novel, the ones that instead most call attention to themselves as \"precious works of art\" more fit for years of overeducated analysis instead of simple pleasure. And in this I guess the so-called \"mainstream literature\" community is just like any community of genre fans as well, in that they are constantly in need of justifying their existence too, constantly in need of explaining why anyone should devote such time and energy doing delicate little analyses of barely readable books. It's disappointing to be sure, to realize that these revered prize lists are in actuality not a reliable way at all to simply find good books by good authors; it's a lesson about the arts I'm reminded of again by The Gravedigger's Daughter, a lesson I think I'll be paying more attention to in the future.Out of 10: 4.8*And since we're on the subject....Sheesh, Oates, will you please stop using exclamation marks! Over and over! In awkward places in your paragraphs! To make your point! Crazy you are driving me! Good literature this is not! Oh, and speaking of which, why like Yoda all your Jewish characters talk? Slightly offensive in a hazily defined way it is!

It deals with Rebecca, the gravedigger's daughter, whose family moved to America just before the 2nd World War started. In many ways, this is a coming-of-age story because we get to hear about Rebecca's life from she's an infant till she's a grown woman. However, Oates' structure is beautifully puzzling as she starts the novel when Rebecca is in her twenties, on her way home from work. This is a story about struggles and how you often repeat patterns in your life, no matter how destructive they may be. It's very clear from the beginning that Rebecca sees herself as 'The Gravedigger's Daughter' because she is living with a constant, terrifying fear of her father who was a monster. Joyce Carol Oates writes beautifully about history and life, and some of her sentences are breath-taking. Meanwhile, I did miss some kind of resolution in the end, especially when it comes to specific characters that we hear nothing about. But other than that, this novel was stunning and it has peaked my interest to get to know Oates' works even better."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1572236-robin", "userReview": "This book would have had much higher marks from me if it would have ended differently.This is my first Joyce Carol Oates read and was for a face to face bookclub. In general I'm not drawn to \"women in jepordy\" stories but I'm always willing to give something new a try.I was drawn to the character Rebecca and wanted to see her life work out for the better. And ultimately things did get better for her. She finally did re-marry although she was permenently damaged from her first husband.The worst thing about this book is, for me it didn't seem to go anywhere. It was simply a chronical of her life. I expected the husband to show up in some climatic scene but he just simply vanished - discovered dead years ago. No phantom here.I'm also VERY confused by the way it ended. In San Francisco after her son plays in the piano concert...did he win? Did he continue with the piano? The letters in the epilogue seemed to indicate he did continue with the piano - but why did we end here? What was the ultimate conflict/resoution of this book? Am I just not \"intelligent\" enough to see some deeper meaning - did it pass over my head?Finally I was even more confused by the series of letters at the end. What a strange segue. They were desperate, pleading, from both sides two woman with only a passing shared past but somehow linked in a way that for me defied logic. The epilogue was so divergent from the rest of the book it was as if I went into a parallel dimension. I keep thinking there must be more \"there\" .... \"there\" but I did not see it. I'll be interesting to hear what the coversation goes like at the bookclub meeting."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "I guess I liked this book, but reading it once is plenty for me. It was very well-written, but I just could not handle how ungodly depressing it was. Honestly, the main character can't seem to go ten pages without getting the shit kicked out of her (literally and figuratively) by all the Mean Bad Men in her life. First there's her father, who goes apeshit when his daughter dares to enter a spelling bee (I still don't get that); then there's her husband, who chooses beating the shit out of her as an acceptable courtship ritual; and then there's the guy she meets after leaving the husband, who never really did anything to her but creeped me out none the less. This book is basically a manual on Why Life Sucks For Everyone, and the worst part is, it doesn't even have an ending. You know those books that just stop? That's what The Gravedigger's Daughter does, and it is irritating. Fun Fact: I read the majority of this book on a 9-hour plane ride, and by doing so discovered a fun challenge: trying to read a book about how evil and crazy men are while 27 Dresses plays on the video screen directly above your line of vision. Looking up from my book about spousal abuse and depression, I would watch Katherine Heigal prancing around onscreen with James Marsden and all I could think was, \"You stupid bitch, get away from him while you still can!

There's never a glimmer of hope, a break from the compounding gloom. As a reader, the weight lands firmly on your shoulders for the length of the book. Join us for a walk of pain.Gravedigger's Daughter is no exception. I felt for the protagonist, I did. I was proud to watch her pull past her shameful upbringing. Glad to see her throw off the shackles of the abusive husband. Excited to observe her raise a piano prodigy.But you know what? The whole time, I knew: None of it would make her thrive.

It is the story of a lifetime, a classic American lifetime from blighted immigrant upbringing to eventual success, or success-through-children as is often the case. In the meantime, much contemplation of the perils of being a women, and of being a single mother, and of being a foreigner. Of perseverance and the loneliness of steadfast purpose, and the necessary but insurmountably isolating walls we build. Strange that other reviews complain that the prose is excessive, as I would actually say that with her more markedly modernist or gothic tendancies reigned in somewhat, Oates' deft, precise touch for the description of details both internal and external is her strongest asset. Her words are crisp and effective, and occasionally glittering, without ever slowing from a brisk and utterly readable presentation. Which is to say that this reads essentially like the literary bestseller that it was, I suppose. I have to admit that such heartfelt realist narratives aren't entirely to my taste these days, but I managed not to be bored for almost 600 pages, which says something. Slows a bit towards the end (inevitably, I was more interested in the protagonist's tumultous youth than ever more stable middle age) but even then, Oates chooses her scenes well to keep things moving along. Oh, and Oates can't possibly shake off her all her gothic predilections, either -- one seemingly inconsequential point resurafaces rather startlingly, tying things a little tighter than expected. And now time to go back to some bizarro sci-fi or something....Lengthy past thoughts at the mid-point: For christmas. This is something like Joyce Carol Oates' 53rd novel (not exaggerating, she's written at least one a year for the length of her productive career, plus buckets of stories). And I'll admit, though I loved her eerie 1976 5-voice stream-of-consciousness nocturne Childwold (a totally random used bookshop selection whose design and first page seemed perfect), that I'm always a little unsure of picking up her others. Why? Because they can't all be good, can they? And I can't possibly dig through all of them in search of more Childwold-caliber material (it's barely on goodreads, and the reviews that there are are pretty middling). And I hear lots of conflicting things about her. Some people complain about her often dense prose and weirdo gothic modernism, some seem to steer clear based on the mass exposure and Oprah-book-clubbing of We Were the Mulvaneys which seems to suggest over-sentiment or something (what it probably actually suggests is overwhelming tragedy, sentimental or not). Some complain that her entire catalog is solid but increasingly redundant as you read more and more of it. So, tricky. So I'm actually pretty grateful for this well-placed gift, to slice through my indecision. And so how is this? I'd worried that modern, more popular Oates might be a little more conservative in prose style, and compared to Childwold, it certainly is. But by normal bestseller standards, it's clear that Oates can really write. With sharp, finely-worked prose, with a decent sense of how to juggle chronology for juxtaposition and pacing, with conviction and convincing voice and convincing, lived sense of the inevitability of tragedy (and a little of that Faulknerian sense of familial doom). So it's pretty good. It captures well the sadness of being alive, the sadness of being an immigrant, The Sadness of Being a Girl (borrowing the phrase from an old Vietnamese psych rock song from this comp), which is what I gather a lot of \"serious\" (i.e. non-gothic, non-pseudonym) Oates is essentially concerned with. But at 600 hundred pages, a lot of this seems inessential, too. Rebecca Schwart's story is perhaps sadly quintessential, and the prose is great line-for-line, but there's nothing here that burns to be spoken, exactly, or that burns to be spoken slowly, over hundreds of pages of carefully-wrought description. (The inessentialness of a long, dense career, maybe. The inessentialness of telling things in great detail just because you can. Or maybe I've been spoiled by compact, concise storytelling lately.) But this sill moves well under its own momentum. I guess I'll have to see where the second half takes me."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565777-christina", "userReview": "This is a book about identity, about coming to terms with your past and being who you are. About family, battered women and their husbands. About the immigrant experience.Oates details the story of Rebecca Schwart's life from her earliest childhood and on. Rebecca is the third child of poor, immigrant Jewish parents who arrived in the States in the 30 and Rebecca was actually born in New York Harbor, making her a US citizen as the only one in the family.The book starts with Rebecca thinking back on her parents - and we learn that her father came to a violent end, but not how - I was instantly hooked. Then the book follows Rebecca in her life as a wife to Niles Tignor and mother of little Niley (Niles Jr.) with flashes back to her childhood with a father being more and more mad and feeling like it was them against the others. He forbade Rebecca's mother to speak German and in that way stripped her of her ability to communicate and be an individual and he controlled everything in the house. In Germany, he was a teacher and a cultured man - in the States he works as the gravedigger doing manual labor and is not respected at all - he and his family are actually victims of some anti-semitic 'jokes', both real and imagined.In Rebecca's current life, she is married and a mother - but her husband perhaps isn't all he claimed to be and Rebecca has to escape with Niley and she starts a new life - as Hazel Jones. She chooses that name because she meets a man one day who thinks she's Hazel Jones and she stars believing she could be.The truth of that encounter is revealed towards the end of the book - in a way, only Oates can pull off.But Hazel manages to - cunningly - create a new life and two new identities for her and her little boy, Zacharias who turns out to be a wonderful piano player - a skill he inherited from his maternal grandmother.In the end, Rebecca comes full circle and face to face with her past.As always, I love the way Oates writes. She seems so in control of her language and her story and characters and everything works together beautifully. Her way of letting a person's thoughts and imaginations being part of the text but written in cursive, makes the characters have so much depth and this was another wonderful book by her.I always say - and write - that Oates write about the American dream gone bad. In this book, she doesn't. Rebecca actually achieve the American dream - she creates a great life for herself and her son. But she does so at a cost - no one knows who she actually is (except Niley/Zacharias who grows detached because of this shared, but hidden, knowledge) and she constantly wears a facade as the perfect woman, always smiling, always pleasing her man. She pays a huge price for this, her chosen way of life - and even though she had to go into hiding to get away from her abusive husband, the question remains whether the way she chose to do it was worth it in the end.And she learns the wisdom of her father's advice: In animal life the weak are quickly disposed of. So you must hide your weakness, Rebecca. We must.. And she does."}, {"userName": "gorecki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3729776-gorecki", "userReview": "When I reached for my first book by Joyce Carol Oates, The Gravedigger's Daughter, I must admit I was expecting a somewhat sugar-coated and sweetened novel about a poor little girl, daughter of refugees from pre-war Germany, who grows up being mocked and bullied by her peers. I was somewhat expecting a novel about pity and unfair treatment. Probably it was the book cover that added a lot in forming this wrong expectation of mine. And while in a sense, I did find pity and drama in this book, they were far from the sugar-coated and sweet, naive rendition I expected. This is a book with a lot of blood, guts, and madness in it.The Gravedigger's Daughter is a novel about growing up in an unhealthy environment, in which everyone slowly looses their mind, sense of reality, or sense of right and wrong. Rebecca Schwart grows up being a part of German disfunctional family of refugees that treat the outer world as a constant threat, everyone else (them, the others) as constantly mocking and will-intentioned, while the family itself is the only place you are being kept safe. As long as you keep your mouth shut. German becomes a forbidden language even behind the closed doors of home, while English is a language still unknown and foreign. Background and history are never to be talked about and every memory of the old world is to be forgotten. The past has never happened and the future is something that \"they, the others\" have already taken. And while the family is trying to stay safe from \"them, the others\", it slowly grinds itself down into hatred, madness, and death. Growing up in such a dark and cold environment in a corner of a cemetary until a tragedy follows as the result of a horrific and destructive crime, Rebecca is being dragged out into the open world of \"the others\" where years later, walking home to her 3-year-old son she meets Hazel Jones. The idea of Hazel Jones. In this novel we follow the struggle for survival of a young woman trying to keep her son safe, while constantly playing Tag with reality and sanity. This gripping novel takes us through the thoughts and actions of a woman very close to losing her mind so many times, while at other times being extremely sharp and clear-minded. A woman trying to build a safe future for herself and her son, while still dragging the shackles of her past with her. A past she is doing her best to hide from, but one that closely follows her everywhere.I was so enthralled by this book that I could not stop reading it for days. But as much as I loved it, I must admit that the ending was a bit too vague for my personal taste. Joyce Carol Oates is a remarkable storyteller, her prose is swift and silky, the story unravels in a perfect pace and with great detail that is rarely superfluous or tedious, but towards the last 100-150 pages I felt a slight shift in its focus, a slight uncertainty in where it's all headed to. Even though I am not in love with the ending itself, however, I am still very fascinated with Oates writing and am already looking forward to reading my next book by her."}, {"userName": "Lucinda K", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848809-lucinda-k", "userReview": "If there were six or seven stars to give them to this book, I would think that not enough!

She never twists the plot, complicates a character, or even executes a sentence for the sake of showing us what she can do. She doesn\u2019t need to. I came with high expectations because of praise and recommendations from friends. But I came, nevertheless, to a book by an author whose assets I thought I had appraised quite well. I\u2019ve come away with new respect for what she can really do. What a priceless experience to be convinced me that one of my two favorite living authors is even better than I thought she was! Despite my usual inclination to hold an editor\u2019s pen in my mind and rewrite anything I thought I could improve, all I ever wanted to do was trade a comma for a semicolon, combine sentences, or perhaps strike out an adjective every 50 pages or so. And even then, a part of me screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything!\u201d I kept wondering how long it took Oates to write this novel (which I intend to find out if I can) and how many times she read it herself to perfect it.

The family tries to assimilate to America, while at the same time maintaining their prejudices and believes about Americans.The story is very violent as Rebecca deals with an abusive and mentally unstable father and depressive mother. When she finally escapes, she marries an abusive husband. She then goes on the run from him with their son and assumes yet another identity.I found the book very negative, however I don't think the author meant it to be. I would read and think \"What else?

But this...this left me wanting, and not in a good way. It actually gave me a headache. I don't know, maybe it was just too much of a cultural difference for me to \"get it\". Maybe it's just too deep for me. Who knows. It was certainly a disappointment."}, {"userName": "Irina Cebanu", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52673821-irina-cebanu", "userReview": "Oates' style is the most beautiful I've yet encountered, non-sophisticated, but appealing at the same time.

Intrigued to read other Oates' books."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "This novel is narrated by the main character, Rebecca, in the third person, primarily using free indirect discourse. Oates\u2019 style is to make liberal use of sentence fragments, and these seem consistent with the FID approach. The initial section of the first of three parts of the book reveals Rebecca as a young woman of about 23, working in a sweatshop factory to support herself and her three-year-old son. Her husband, Niles Trignor, is often away from home at unknown locations for days and weeks at a time and is narcissistic and abusive, Rebecca accepting the passive role as her lot and making no attempt to challenge him or extricate herself from the situation. References are made to her hatred of her deceased father, who seems to have died violently.The second major section of the novel jumps back to Rebecca\u2019s childhood. Her parents were immigrants from Germany in 1936, settling in rural upstate New York. Her two older brothers traveled across the Atlantic with her parents, but she was actually born on the ship in NY Harbor, just as they arrived in the US. Her father, a university-educated high school math teacher in Germany (and the narrative suggests that the family is Jewish, although the parents deny and hate Judaism), is given the job of cemetery caretaker and gravedigger. Rebecca\u2019s home life is very emotionally impoverished and physically abusive.Oates\u2019 use of dialogue is skillful; each character speaks distinctively, consistent with his or her personality, contributing to Oates\u2019 development of psychology and plot.Among other things, this novel is an exploration of the role and experience of the outsider, the \u201cother.\u201d And of the extent to which environment determines one\u2019s character and fate. Rebecca\u2019s family is accused of being Jewish, \u201cKrauts,\u201d Nazis, and their place as poor, uneducated, of marginal occupation make them perfect targets for the citizens of their small community. This part of the novel draws to a close as the mystery of what happened to Rebecca\u2019s parents is revealed. After a few chapters outlining her life during the following few years, Niles Tignor enters the story. He and Rebecca eventually marry, largely because she will only submit to him sexually if they are married. Their relationship, which becomes physically abusive to her (she accepts that as \u201cwhat she deserves\u201d), is based on his intense sexual desire for her and her need to be needed and desired, there being little mutual sharing in any other way - she knows little about him and is not welcome to ask. One wonders how her background has driven this dynamic. Finally, after another severe beating from her \u201chusband\u201d (having learned that her marriage might not be valid), Rebecca flees with her son, thus ending Part I of three parts of the novel.Oates has skillfully crafted an atmosphere that is oppressive and claustrophobic, the reader being powerfully drawn into Rebecca\u2019s consciousness. The metaphors in this writing are sharp and effective, often passing subliminally in the reader\u2019s own awareness.In Part II, having changed her name and that of her son, Rebecca (now \u201cHazel\u201d) works in a variety of menial jobs in a series of small towns in Upstate New York, always on the move, always providing little information about her background to those who ask. And increasingly the narrative moves into using free indirect discourse to explore the consciousness of \u201cZack,\u201d her son. During the following few years, Hazel establishes a new identity, gradually becoming less vigilant about being found by Tignor. She is romantically pursued by Chet Gallagher, a well-to-do jazz pianist who is emotionally estranged from his wealthy family and very needy in his own right. Zack, in the meantime, is proving to be a musical prodigy, excelling at the piano. But Hazel continues to be wary, refusing to commit herself to a new relationship and hiding all aspects of her background. Eventually, though, she and Zack move in with Gallagher. Later, Hazel learns that Tignor is dead. Part III, containing an Epilogue, is by far the shortest part of the novel. The denouement is as fitting as it is unexpected and thought-provoking.This is a masterfully written novel, technically skillful and emotionally insightful, opening up new worlds and experiences to the reader and thus enlarging the reader\u2019s own humanity, a privilege to have read and pondered."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie", "userReview": "This was a very hard book to read. It\u2019s not that it is poorly written; it\u2019s that the protagonist\u2019s situation struck a raw note and was so painful for me to read about. Rebecca Schwart\u2019s life is all about fear. From the time she is a small child, fear rules her life. Daughter of immigrants who fled the Nazis, she lives in horrible poverty, her father being reduced from a high school math teacher in Germany to a cemetery caretaker in America. Understandably bitter by their reduced circumstances and the way they are treated by Americans, her father is authoritarian and abusive, taking his anger and defeat out on his family. Rebecca learns to be what her father wants her to be to keep things running smoothly. After tragedy turns her out on her own, she uses this talent of being what others want her to be to her advantage. It keeps her alive through brutal marriage; it enables her to run and start a new life. Sadly, although Rebecca (now living under the name of Hazel Jones- even that name is a case of her becoming what someone else wants her to be) manages to make her way to a good life, she loses herself. She\u2019s incredibly perceptive as to what people want, and very adept at giving them that. While she certainly has standards- she is firm as to what lines she will not cross- she does not present her real self to a single person. She is more mirror than human. It\u2019s what most every person in an abusive relationship learns to do; Rebecca just takes it much further than most do. After getting involved with her first husband, she has not pursued a single thing she really wanted to do other than raise her beloved and musically gifted son. In this novel of 580 pages, we never do find out what Rebecca wanted out of life other than to raise her son safely. It\u2019s a powerful book. I found it painfully long and slow, but could not stop reading, wondering if Rebecca could keep up the act and not make a misstep that would cause her house of cards to tumble down. If you want to see some of the psychological effects of being in an abusive, manipulative, relationship are, read this book. If you have been in that kind of relationship, you might find this book to be very triggering."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142793-debbie", "userReview": "I've read her short stories but this is my first novel. She can surely write. I love her style and while the story is quite graphic in its violence and abuse, it was not gratuitous, but necessary, handled well. It was a story of survival, escape. One family escapes the holocaust only to confront isolation and prejudice in America, eventually leading a father to insanity and self-destruction. The journey of the surviving daughter reveals another from of persecution--the persecution of women/ a woman. Still, she manages to survive by using the male's vulnerability to sexual manipulation to her advantage. She also survives by giving up her identity in order to hide from her first abusive relationship. That she escaped persecution of Jews only to be forced to give up her identity to escape persecution from an abusive man is rather ironic. In fact, this irony comes back at the end of the novel. The irony of two types of persecutions. Two ways of escape.The other family in the background (until the end) are Rebecca's cousins, who do not escape Germany. Rebecca's cousin, close in age to Rebecca, loses her family to the holocaust; however she survives. Unlike Rebecca, she embraces her identity, even writes a book about her tragedy, exaggerating in order to exploit. The irony of this story of escape and survival is complex and fascinating. I love how Oates turns it around, shows the communication in the end as a way of revealing the similarities and differences of character, the similarities and differences of different types of persecution. An interesting and complex way of ending the story.I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Joy H.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259216-joy-h", "userReview": "I have finished reading TGD. As I have said, it was a great story, stylishly written... and the ending was a good one, except for some questions the book has left me with. In the final pages we read letters from a cousin of the main character. The cousin was a holocaust survivor and in her letter makes some vague references to the holocaust. One letter reads as follows: \"... the holocaust was an accident in history as all events in history are accidents... The pious fantasizers wish to claim that the Nazi's genocidal campaign was a singular event in history, that it has elevated us above history. This is bullshit... There are many genocides, so long as there has been mankind. History is an invention of books.\"I wondered if the cousin were trying to minimize the holocaust and why. I wonder what Joyce Carol Oates was trying to say by including that passage in the final pages of the book. It seemed to suddenly shift the emphasis of the story in some way. I was left off balance. I had expected closure of some sort for the main character. She had finally survived her terrible life's journey and had also located her long lost cousin. But the long lost cousin takes the book into what seems to be an ambiguous and unsettling tangent. Could it be that Oates had intended the book's ending to be unsettling and controversial? Maybe.=======================================================================You may also be interested in my discussion topic at: ====>http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1..."}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5934795-alisa", "userReview": "The first half of this novel was so angry, practically dripping with Jacob Schwart's spittle-rage and Tignor's controlling misogyny!

It is a tribute to the author's ability that I kept reading at all. A less well-written book I certainly would've put down. But Rebecca's unique survival story, one in which she crafts a new identity to serve as a camouflaged flak jacket, was compelling enough to keep me going. I found the ending just as satisfying as a novel like this can provide. No, it doesn't paint a rosy picture of long-lost cousins hugging and becoming the true selves they've been hiding for decades.

But there were these phrases that Oates kept returning to, such as the final one, \"There should be some reason she survived,\" (p. 551).

Oates has published so many books, I\u2019ve lost count of just how many, though I\u2019m pretty certain this is her thirty-sixth novel. But even though I want to trust this author to take me on an interesting and unforgettable literary journey, there\u2019s always been something about Oates\u2019 work that won\u2019t let me get truly involved. Some of her books, like Soltice, just leave me cold, while others, like American Appetites and Blonde are books I enjoyed, to an extent, but still couldn\u2019t find any connection with the characters. Still others, like Bellefleur, are books I thought I might love, but books I gave up on and didn\u2019t even finish. So, when I decided to read The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter, I really didn\u2019t know what to expect. I had no idea if I was going to love the book, hate it, or something in between, but enough time had gone by since my previous attempt at reading Oates to give one of her books another try.The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter is the story of Rebecca Schwart, whose family fled Nazi Germany in 1936 for a small town a little south of Niagara Falls. Rebecca, herself, was born on the ship while it was in New York Harbor. Although her father, Jacob Schwart, was a well-liked math teacher at a Munich boys\u2019 school, as well as a skilled pressman, in America, the only job Jacob can get is that of a gravedigger in semi-rural Milburn, New York. By this time, Jacob is \u201c...a broken man...a man whose guts had been eaten out by rats.\u201d He and his family, which includes his half-mad wife, Anna, take up residence in a small stone cottage near the cemetery gate. In a nice bit of symbolism, the very water the Schwart family drinks is polluted with the spirits of the dead.Rebecca\u2019s eldest brother Herschel, a ne\u2019er-do-well who forgets his German without ever gaining a mastery of English, flees town after committing a crime. The younger son, August, also walks away from Jacob after enduring one too many cruelties. Both brothers leave without so much as a \u201cgoodbye\u201d for their little sister, Rebecca. It isn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t like her. They\u2019ve just learned what their father has always taught them: \u201cNever say it.\u201d Let the past be the past; let it, like the family\u2019s Jewishness, remain dead and buried.For Jacob and Anna, however, the past can never truly be left in the past; it can never really die. Jacob grows more and more haunted by the Nazi demons he wanted to leave behind, and more specifically by an act of betrayal he committed in order to get his family out of Germany. His past, in combination with his prejudiced and humiliated present, finally drives Jacob to an incredible act of violence and cruelty that both traumatizes Rebecca and yet frees her to go into the world alone and reshape her life.Male violence is a theme Oates has revisited time and time again, and I have no doubt she\u2019ll revisit it in future books as well. At least three times in this book, Rebecca Schwart flees male violence. Despite the fact that Jacob Schwart used to tell his daughter, \u201cYou are born here, they will not hurt you,\u201d Rebecca learns that yes, indeed, people will hurt her, and they do. In one of the novel\u2019s creepiest set pieces, Rebecca encounters a man on the path she takes home from work, only to discover later that he\u2019s a serial killer with many victims, and that she, herself, almost joined their ranks. And, in another nice bit of symbolism, Rebecca recalls how the only game she ever played with her father was one in the cemetery, in which Jacob pretended not to see her. Rebecca knows that \u201cRebecca Schwart\u201d needs to disappear. For good. And so, after one violent episode, Rebecca renames herself \u201cHazel Jones,\u201d not knowing that Hazel Jones is the name of a woman who died at the hands of a violent man; her young son, Niley becomes Zacharias. Still, Rebecca will learn, as did her parents, that our past is always with us, no matter how hard we try to deny and outrun it.For Rebecca Schwart\u2019s past comes to haunt even Hazel Jones. She remembers how, as a young child, when she was still Rebecca, she was told the Morgensterns were coming to live with her own family, and she would have a big sister in her cousin, Freyda Morgenstern. The ship the Morgensterns were traveling on was turned away from the US and sent back to Germany, however, and the entire Morgenstern family was thought to have died. All the Schwarts have left of the Morgenstern family is an old photograph, and Rebecca spends much time gazing at the little girl who looks out at her from the photo. Freyda Morgenstern finally becomes an imaginary friend, and one that Rebecca will encounter much later in her life, after she\u2019s left at least the financial poverty of the past behind for a life of wealth and privilege.I thought Rebecca/Hazel was a fully realized and complex character, and though Oates certainly wants us to sympathize/empathize with her, she isn\u2019t afraid to let us see the real Rebecca/Hazel, warts and all. And Rebecca/Hazel certainly has faults. She\u2019s far from perfect, and I greatly preferred her that way. The secondary characters \u2013 Jacob, Anna, Herschel, and August \u2013 weren\u2019t given such complexity. They have their identities, assigned to them by Oates, and they act in accordance with these assigned identities. They aren\u2019t caricatures, by any means, but neither do they thrive.The writing, of course, is Joyce Carol Oates, and Oates does have a unique style, though I would never term her a \u201cprose stylist\u201d in the sense of say, Edna O\u2019Brien. Oates\u2019 writing, to me, always seems a little heavy and turbulent and at odds with itself, and even, at times, rushed. In The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter, Oates had a maddening habit of using \u201cthat\u201d instead of \u201cwhich\u201d in a nonrestrictive clause, e.g., \u201c...most of the papers continued to run Chet Gallagher\u2019s column, that had won national awards.\u201d At first, I thought it might be an attempt at a new stylistic device, but later, I decided no, it was far too awkward and ugly for that. It was carelessness, and I\u2019m very surprised at such carelessness in a writer with as many books under her belt as Oates.The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter is at its most engaging when Rebecca/Hazel is narrating, and especially when she\u2019s describing her growing love for Chet Gallagher, son of a wealthy family, who plays jazz piano and wants Rebecca to let him give both her and Niley/Zach a new chance at life. The book loses power when Oates switches to the very angry Niley/Zach\u2019s point of view or to Chet\u2019s, even when they are talking about Rebecca/Hazel. Unfortunately, Niley/Zach and Chet simply aren\u2019t as complex or as interesting as Rebecca.I\u2019ve already mentioned the rich symbolism to be found in this book. There are many vivid descriptions as well. For example, Jacob is described as a \u201c...troll man...like a creature who has emerged from the earth, slightly bent, broken-backed and with his head carried at an awkward angle so that he seemed always to be peering at the world suspiciously.\u201d Now that is really first rate writing.For those readers who are putting off reading the book lest it be too depressing, never fear. Though it tackles weighty themes \u2013 male violence, the Holocaust, the guilt of survivors \u2013 this is not a depressing book. On the other hand, it\u2019s not exactly life affirming, either. And there\u2019s no lightness or joy in this book. I guess I would call it \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cgritty.\u201d At times the narrative was possessed of such grittiness that I felt I had to take a long, hot shower, and that might not be a bad thing as far as this book goes. (I shower or bathe every night, regardless.) At other times, the book felt very courageous. Anyone who\u2019s read much of Oates\u2019 work will know that she has a penchant for melodrama, and she likes to pin her novels to some \u201cbig event\u201d that happened in the past. And so it is in The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter. Any book that contains as much violence and anger as this one is going to slip into melodrama at times, though for the most part, Oates does manage to keep it under control. Of course, the \u201cbig event\u201d in this book is the Holocaust, though this is not, in any way, a \u201cHolocaust book,\u201d at least it\u2019s not to my way of thinking.I like ambiguous endings in books. I don\u2019t need everything tied up in a nice, neat little package like it\u2019s waiting for Christmas morning. Some authors try so hard to come up with the \u201cperfect\u201d ending that the result is an ending that just doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s not organic, that doesn\u2019t flow from the events that took place in the book. Better, I think, to leave some things open-ended. That said, the ending Oates wrote for The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter was just beyond the pale. I thought there were pages missing from my book. Really. I\u2019m still not totally convinced there aren\u2019t. I stayed up last night to finish this book, and the ending left me dazed and confused. I have no idea what I was supposed to take from that. If anyone does, please let me in on the secret.And of course, there\u2019s the epilogue. The epilogue takes place twenty-five years after the events in the novel proper, and it consists of an exchange of letters between a sixty-two year old Hazel, who is now Rebecca again, and her long lost cousin, Freyda Morgenstern, who apparently did not perish at sea. At first, I loved this epilogue. It brings the novel full circle and plunges Rebecca back into the midst of her family again, even if the person pulling her in is a long lost cousin she\u2019s never even met. Rebecca and Freyda never seem to be on the same page, however. One seems to want the relationship, while the other does not, then the tide turns, and the pursuer becomes the pursued. I thought the point of these letters was to show us that one can change his or her name over and over again, but one really can\u2019t cut family ties. The family Rebecca ran away from as a young woman is the family she needs in middle age. Now, however, I\u2019m not so sure of the point. For me, that\u2019s typical with Joyce Carol Oates. She often raises more questions than she answers.Most of Oates\u2019 books do end with a question, but it\u2019s a question that has some relevance to all that has gone before. I\u2019ve never seen an Oates\u2019 ending quite like this one before. The final words of the book \u2013 \u201cYet I think I should come to Lake Worth, to see you. Should I?\u201d \u2013 just sort of leave the reader with a sense of disbelief more than anything else, I think. I could feel my thoughts reverberating through the silence. Maybe that\u2019s the point. Once again, I don\u2019t know. For a while last night, I thought that after thirty-six novels and sixty odd books, Joyce Carol Oates just didn\u2019t care, and if readers didn\u2019t like the way she ended her books, well, they could just go write their own and end them any darn way they pleased.So, did I like the book, or did I dislike the book? I\u2019m not sure. I know I didn\u2019t love it. I don\u2019t think many/any readers are going to love this book. This isn\u2019t Possession or Great Expectations or Jane Eyre or The Woman in White where readers turn the last page, close the book, sigh, and say, \u201cWow! What a book!\u201d I did, however, greatly admire the book. I felt I learned something, but I\u2019m not sure what. I think every reader is going to react very differently to this book, much more so than with most books from other authors.All in all, I\u2019m glad I read The Gravedigger\u2019s Daughter, and I\u2019m glad I revisited Oates. Now, I wonder how long it\u2019ll be before I\u2019m tempted to pick up another one of this very polarizing author\u2019s books. Honestly, I have no idea.4.5/5Recommended: This is Joyce Carol Oates. Read at your own peril.Note: Oates has said she based this novel, in part, on her maternal great-grandmother, who, she learned, was Jewish.

Me ha gustado."}], "description": "In 1936 the Schwarts, an immigrant family desperate to escape Nazi Germany, settle in a small town in upstate New York, where the father, a former high school teacher, is demeaned by the only job he can get: gravedigger and cemetery caretaker. After local prejudice and the family's own emotional frailty result in unspeakable tragedy, the gravedigger's daughter, Rebecca, begins her astonishing pilgrimage into America, an odyssey of erotic risk and imaginative daring, ingenious self-invention, and, in the end, a bittersweet - but very \"American\" - triumph. \"You are born here, they will not hurt you\" - so the gravedigger has predicted for his daughter, which will turn out to be true.In The Gravedigger's Daughter, Oates has created a masterpiece of domestic yet mythic realism, at once emotionally engaging and intellectually provocative: an intimately observed testimony to the resilience of the individual to set beside such predecessors as The Falls, Blonde, and We Were the Mulvaneys.", "title": "The Gravedigger's Daughter", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1365395.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "average": 3.53, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348846595l/1365395.jpg", "reviews": 1035, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1365395.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1140646.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15781622-fiica-groparului", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6409760-la-hija-del-sepulturero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7631603-la-hija-del-sepulturero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11785.Zombie"]}
