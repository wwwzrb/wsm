This is another page turning machine, I\u2019ve read that this is a few of my friend\u2019s favourite Lisa Gardner book, and I can see why. Here we meet the really lovely Annabelle (or is she?) who has spent her entire life on the run, taught by her expert father, to be always ready to leave, life's contents in a handful of bags. Always ready to run, and never ready to commit to anything, or anyone. Again I think D.D takes back seat to now Detective Bobby Dodge, his story is developed more in this installment, and it\u2019s great to see how he progresses from book number two to where we see him now. Bobby is a truly likable character, and the banter between him and D.D. always enjoyable, it's nice reading about these two, and how much they know about each other, and their love for their very high pressure jobs.A splattering of tense romance, which I always enjoy, made this a wonderful read. My new measure of performance is my ha ha 6 star rating, Lisa Gardner has delivered again for this happy and most satisfied reader.

Serious question. I mean, I like Det. Dodge enough. But I really like Det. D.D. Warren - not in a sexual way, but almost. I went into this series looking for a badass female lead. Instead the star, for both this book and the last, is the penis who can't stop sleeping with the female victims. Boooooooring. (Not really, this is actually a fun book.) D.D. seems like the type of woman who would wear thigh high leather boots, step in your ass crack with the stiletto heel and tell you what a bad boy, or girl, you've been. Not that I'm into that. And, also, not that there's anything wrong with being into that. An orgasm is an orgasm. Look! All I'm saying is I would totally do her. Hide picks up some time after Alone ended. Bobby Dodge is now working with the Massachusetts State Police after he killed a man in the last story, and is still dealing with all his malemotions (Trademarked 2016 by Me) because of it, when D.D. calls him from a crime scene at an abandoned mental hospital. Let's just say dead children and move on from this part of the review, shall we?\n\n\"My whole family disappeared... I can't afford to come back from the dead.\"\n\nSomehow tied to the mental hospital is Annabelle Granger. On the run with her parents since she was seven - a new town and new names every year due to her father's paranoid insistence that her life was in danger - Annabelle is listed as one of the dead children found on the mental hospital's grounds. The only problem is Annabelle is only dead on the inside (just like me. #kindredspirits)Her parents are legit dead though, their ashes hanging on a necklace around her neck (#creeeppppy) so she's never found out who or what she's been hiding from for 25 years. Living in Boston under a new name, she's forced into a decision: let everyone think she was one of the dead children, including her mystery threat - or come forward to the police, giving them a new lead that might potentially bring justice and closure to those who need it. Annabelle decides to do the right thing, which puts her in dangers as all the pieces of her past are revealed one by one until...You know how it goes.I like Gardner's writing style and character development, aside from Bobby's need to fuck the victims and the serious lack of scenes featuring D.D. The plot was intricate and revealed all the twisty-pretzel bits with perfect timing, and my feels took a direct hit when Annabelle's dog got stabbed and she fought for her life.Maybe I'm not so dead inside after all.I will be definitely be reading the next in the series, while hoping for a little more stiletto in my ass crack this time (metaphorically, of course.)"}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean", "userReview": "My, oh my! Lisa Gardner had me scratching my head time and again as I read Hide, the second in her D.D. Warren mystery thriller series. Where do I start? Do I start with the six mummified corpses discovered in an underground hideaway on the grounds of the abandoned Mattapan State Hospital for the mentally ill? Do I start with Annabelle, the girl whose necklace is around the neck of one of the unfortunate victims? \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d now an adult, is very much alive. Whose body wears the necklace? Who killed those girls? Is he still out there somewhere killing other young girls? Bobby Dodge, still reeling from his last case as a Boston police sniper, is now a detective with the Massachusetts State Police. He receives a call from his old pal and ex-girlfriend, Sergeant D.D. Warren of Boston P.D. requesting his assistance on a case. Don\u2019t ask questions or listen to the police scanner. Just get here. STAT. What he sees in that chamber calls to mind another case and another victim. Has his worst nightmare returned?Annabelle Granger sees her name in the paper as one of the victims, and she knows she must go to the police. She has been on the run her whole life. When she was five, her father met her at the door with packed suitcases, and her family moved from Boston to Florida. They changed their names. This happened every few years. It happened so often that Annabelle was always looking over her shoulder. She never knew whom to trust. She didn\u2019t even know her real name. The strangest thing was that she didn\u2019t even know what they were running from. Annabelle, the name she identifies with most, decides to stay in Boston. It is the last stop after many moves. She has multiple locks on her doors. She has a dog. She practices martial arts. But who is she? She inserts herself into the case, feeling she has an invested interest. She was declared dead, after all. Bobby, as we learned in the first book, Alone, is susceptible to vulnerable, beautiful women who just happen to be central figures in his cases. Does this happen in real life? Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly adds a tinge of romantic tension to Ms. Gardner\u2019s fiction. Drama too, and that doesn\u2019t make D.D. happy. No siree. I found myself feeling a bit foggy on the details of that previous case, which is mentioned not infrequently in Hide. But there are enough reminders for it to make sense to me and enable me to connect the dots somewhat.That\u2019s not saying that I figured the whole thing out. Not by a long shot! I was constantly wondering what the heck Annabelle\u2019s father had them running from, or if perhaps he was really a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. The author did a fantastic job sowing seeds of doubt here, there, and everywhere. There are a number of characters that are bad guys, but none is THE bad guy. There are several red herrings, and even when I did consider the persons who were actually dangerous, I could never be sure, because there were so many twists. The bottom line: TRUST NO ONE.Annabelle is an enigma. She\u2019s been through a lot. She seems to not know who she is, and who can blame her? Yet, she functions. She runs her own home-based business. On the surface, she seems self-sufficient, but she is frightened and alone. Will she go it alone, or will she let herself trust Bobby?\tThis book is billed as \u201cDetective D.D. Warren #2.\u201d There is much more of D.D. in this story than in book one, but it is still very much Bobby Dodge\u2019s show. This is Bobby\u2019s first case as a detective, and while he has a lot to learn, he has good instincts, other than letting himself have feelings for a woman who\u2019s a key part of the case. D.D. seems to be a hard-core cop. She\u2019s all business. I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s under that tough exterior. We know that she and Bobby tried and failed to have a relationship. I do like observing the interplay between Bobby and D.D. and the unease that lies beneath the surface of their interactions.I also found it interesting that Ms. Gardner chose to write Annabelle\u2019s chapters in first person and the police procedural sections in third person. I believe she deliberately sets Annabelle\u2019s experience apart from that of the detectives who are tasked with solving the case. Rather than finding this bothersome, I actually liked it; in fact, I hardly noticed it most of the time because it felt quite natural.So \u2013 how do I conclude this? I could go on and on, but I don\u2019t want to give away any more of the plot. Parts of it are a little bit over the top, but I guess that\u2019s why it\u2019s called fiction. I could rave for days about this book, but your time would be better spent reading the book! Seek out Hide. You won\u2019t be sorry!5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jennifer McLean", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2032506-jennifer-mclean", "userReview": "I really enjoy D.D. Warren books and this is the best one in the series. I've read both ones before and ones after this one but this is the best one I've read. I would recommend reading the previous D.D Warren book before this one, it's named \"Alone\". The stories are tangentially connected and reading Alone first will add depth and dimension to this book. Once again Warren and Dodge work together and since they bring out the best and worst in each other, the ride is extra fun.

He is now a homicide detective working for Warren who has been promoted. They have to investigate the deaths of six young girls, whose bodies have been found in an underground chamber on the site of a formal mental hospital.There are lots of crossovers here with the events of the previous book Alone which means that I wouldn't recommend that anyone read this book as a stand-alone as there would definitely be a sense of not getting the full story from Hide. I once again liked Bobby's character, and I liked the new chapters from the POV of Annabelle. The 'whodunit' aspect of the plot was genuinely perplexing to me; one moment I thought I'd figured out the killer, then I would change my mind, then I was definitely sure I knew, only to find out my theories were way off track by the end. I read this book quicker than the previous instalment; it was more compelling and it helped that Annabelle was a much nicer and more interesting character than Catherine.I am enjoying this series, and looking forward to the next book The Neighbour which I did read as a standalone around seven years ago. I don't remember much about the plot but I'm sure I will enjoy reading it again."}, {"userName": "ElaineY", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1301782-elainey", "userReview": "WARNING: not a review, more a rant.I think those \"tall stiletto boots\" and \"wild mass of blonde curls\" on top of the slim-fitting jeans and tight-fitting shirt was just too much for me. I wanted to gag. I was pulled out of the story and wondered, momentarily, whether the author was a man using a female pseudonym. I paused my audio to google whether real-life cops in Boston (or anywhere) wore stiletto heels to work and actually found some interesting articles but all from Europe - where stiletto heels were deemed unsuitable and inappropriate for work. Hmm, and I thought it was the Americans who were prudes.In Russia, female cops dressed like this are being disciplined, though, to be fair, it was the short skirts, not the high heels, that were the cause of the Interior Ministry's ire.In Mexico, those stiletto boots really were to be blamed...The entire unit of 20 female cops, in the city of Aguascalientes in Central Mexico, were disbanded because they were hurting the force's image. I'm sure Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n aka El Chapo, would disagree.So alright, those pics are of police officers in uniform and DD is a homicide detective and does not wear a uniform so it's petty and unreasonable of me to criticize her choice of footwear. But waitaminute, there's an old 80s LAPD show, Hunter, featuring a pair or homicide detectives, Sgt. Rick Hunter and Sgt. Dee Dee McCall. See what happens when this Dee Dee wears heels while taking down a suspect/perp:You lose your high-heeled shoe and your partner ends up giving it back to you.Of course, he could end up keeping and wearing it like these Canadian cops:Hard for me to concentrate on a book after it does that to me. My 3 stars is reflective of the sour mood I was in - 3 stars has come to signify a so-so review for most Goodreads reviewers though there are those who follow GR's definition of 3 stars denoting 'good' or you liked it. My 3 stars here indicate it was just a so-so listen though I concede there's a much better story in there than I experienced. I didn't dislike DD because of her stilettos, though, but because of the way she treated Annabelle when the latter went to the station to tell the detectives what she'd been holding onto. DD was such a bitch, accusing Annabelle of wanting media attention instead of taking her seriously. Even if her suspicions were understandable, all DD needed to do was to test Annabelle by asking about certain details not known to the public. In the end, DD did exactly that by bringing out a locket and asking Annabelle about it.Perhaps one day, after I've forgiven and forgotten what Ms Gardner did to DD, I might relisten to this and end up with a 5-star book. After all, I detested Tess Gerritsen's Jane Rizzoli but Jane changed and now I'm hooked on the series....then again, that could be because Rizzoli doesn't wear stilettos to work.

Her father, a professor of mathematics at MIT, arrived home one night, quickly packed some bags, and told her and her mother that they were leaving Boston. To seven-year-old Annabelle, it was exciting: they were running away from home.They never stopped running after that night.Every new town was a new name and a potential new threat. The problem was that Annabelle never knew what that threat was. Her father never told her what they were running from. He simply taught her how not to trust anyone, how to fight back, and how to run and hide if she couldn\u2019t fight.She continued to run and hide, long after both her parents were dead, until one day, at age 22, when she saw a news story about the discovery of six bodies discovered on the grounds of an abandoned mental hospital outside Boston. The details of the news story were vague, but instinctually Annabelle knew that bodies were all of young girls, and she knew one of them was her best friend. It was finally time for her to stop running and hiding.Thus begins Lisa Gardner\u2019s intense thriller, \u201cHide\u201d. The novel features a pair of recurring characters, Boston PD detectives D.D. Warren and Bobby Dodge. There is, apparently, a lot of back-story with these two: former lovers, now strictly a professional relationship, but still clearly in love with each other. One can piece together a little bit of the back-story (it probably would have helped to start reading the books in order), but none of it is essential in understanding the main mystery at the heart of the story, which belongs mostly to Annabelle.Annabelle tries to do the right thing by going to the police with her story. When she first encounters skepticism and suspicion, she decides to play private detective to her own life mystery: What, or who, scared her father so much that he uprooted his family and left a decent-paying job? Why was her best childhood friend, along with five other girls, brutally murdered? Why does she seem to be the connection to all of it? During her investigation (with the reluctant help of Dodge and Warren), she discovers a possible link with a serial killer that abducted and tortured a young girl several years before her family left Boston. There are several other viable suspects, as well, all of them in some way connected to the abandoned mental hospital where the bodies were found.As she delves deeper into her past, she begins to realize why her father was so paranoid. He had reason to be. And that reason may be catching up to her, quickly... Gardner tells a fast-paced, well-plotted, and extremely suspenseful story. I\u2019m definitely going to be reading more of her books.

Hide by Lisa Gardner is Mystery/Suspense book that has one of the most fascinating set-ups I could imagine. Twists and turns all over the place. It's very unpredictable. There are two story lines: one of a survivor who must piece together her true identity, and the mystery of solving the heinous murder of 6 girls. Their bodies nearly mumified and found hidden at a scary, old abandoned mental institution-- in a make shift dungeon. It's a hell of a page turner. (It is not romance. Although there is some chemistry that builds and surprised the heck out of me. And a hottie detective that all the ladies like;) Tana French is my favorite suspense/crime writer. Faithful Place is one of my favorites ever. (unbelievably good narrator) however, Hide proved to me that Lisa Gardner is up there with the best of them, even Ms. French.

Her books are generally well-written, but all the good writing in the world can't make up for bad characterization and poorly structured plot. What really sticks out to me with this novel was the ill-planned reveal of the criminal's identity.I was ready to go along with the switches from first to third person, because while I usually find it annoying, I get that some authors find it a useful plot device, but in this case it just felt lazy, like Gardner had already written the first person sections and was too lazy to change them when she realized she wasn't able to keep her entire book in first person. That alone wasn't enough to make or break it for me, but alas, where this book really fails is in tying together all the threads of mystery. Instead of one bad guy it turns out we have two. Instead of the logical explanation, we get two convoluted ones.Basically, the ending felt like Gardner was trying too hard to be clever about who did it. It also ended up feeling like two novels she'd squished together into one, which wasn't annoying until the ending.

I understand that the plot needs to flow and all, and that the author is bound and determined to bring together all these unrelated bits and fit them together, but still. And oh my god, why must the stupid main cop always develop a romantic interest in the \"victim?!\" (Except they never exactly are victims, but clearly they are supposed to fill that role.)

I prefer a book focusing on the investigation, the investigators and the possible victims and their families. I love police procedural, and this was a good one. I am so tired of books where we are in the mind of those perpetrators. There\u2019s too many of them. It\u2019s tedious - and what's the upside, I ask you? Unfortunately, Lisa Gardner does that same thing in her following books. So yes those are not as good in my opinion.This book is all about unraveling a mystery - and I absolutely enjoyed the enigma that involves Annabelle\u2019s family. For the longest time from the age of seven, her life has been about running. Her parents moved around so much, escaping some unknown danger, leaving one city for another, at the drop of a hat. Now Annabelle, at the age of thirty-two, under the name Tanya, lives in Boston again, her parents deceased. When police discover an underground chamber on the grounds of a derelict mental institute, containing six bodies, one of the young victims has a necklace with Annabelle\u2019s full name on her. The good thing about this story is that we really don\u2019t know who the bad guy is until the very end. What I also enjoyed is that we see Bobby Dodge return, this time as a State Police detective. Bobby joins the investigation at D.D. Warren's request. Bobby\u2019s friendship with D.D. Warren is a longstanding one and their banter is very entertaining. Finally, I am glad that Bobby and Annabelle became interested in each other. Their coming together was a bit more subtle and promising.Over the next books, we get little snippets about how Annabelle and Bobby are doing. I hope Lisa Gardner will consider a story where Bobby Dodge takes on a more prominent role again."}, {"userName": "Asghar Abbas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37421322-asghar-abbas", "userReview": "A truly scary book. This isn't a horror genre per se, it's disturbing because all the horror in it is man made. Man is horror. I didn't know it was a part of a series. I thought this was a stand alone book. It's that good. Without having a single ghost or ghoul in it, it is scary. And now it's about monsters and oval shaped offices. Things being bent out of shape. Sometimes blunt. Sometimes clever. Sometimes not even real. In real life evil doesn't know it is evil. That's for history to decide. Even then that's not enough. What to do when villains won't confine themselves to History and remain there."}, {"userName": "Maud", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50329680-maud", "userReview": "wederom een prachtig geschreven verhaal.

This was one book I couldn't put down. It begins with the discovery of six mummified corpses in an underground chamber, in the grounds of an abandoned mental hospital, shocking even the most hardened cop. The discovery bares a strong resemblance to a very old case where the perpetrator was caught and is now dead. Did the dead psychopath have a protege or is there a copycat who is far more dangerous and cunning? Massachusetts State Detective Bobby Dodge is forced to team up with an old partner, Boston Detective D.D Warren who worked on the old case, their only clue is a locket with the inscription Annabelle Granger, which is attached to one of the mummified corpses. The case becomes more complex when a woman walks into the police department claiming she is Annabelle Granger and has been hiding for most of her life. The detectives are first faced with the question \"Is this woman speaking the truth, or is she just another crazy wanting attention?' Lisa Gardner's intricate and very clever story will keep you on the edge of your seat, taking you on a journey of many twists and turns, which slowly unravels to reveal the killer's identity and a very nail-biting end. If you like a good thriller, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "Unbelievable.Never believe anything Lisa Gardner tells you.

Hide is the follow-up to Lisa Gardner\u2019s Alone, the 1st book in her Det. D.D. Warren Series, I was totally captivated. Hide can be read alone but I suggest one reads Alone first which gives you a better understanding of the characters that reappear in this story. From the moment I opened the first page and read the first sentence \u2013 \u201cMy father explained it to me the first time when I was seven years old\u201d \u2013 I knew that I was going to be totally engrossed and captivated by Annabelle Granger\u2019s story.The idea of a family being on the run for over 25 years and the unexpected death of Annabelle\u2019s father before the secrets are revealed is very smart and ingenious. As a parent, I was chilled to the bone on realizing how vulnerable our children are to the danger they can encounter with deranged people, who often go unseen in our midst. The plot is clever, fast paced, spellbinding and nail biting and I was amazed how the author kept me guessing until the end \u2013 though a time or two I thought I knew who the \u201cbad guy/s\u201d, where, I was thrown another clue. What was the mystery about Annabelle\u2019s life I wanted to know? So I kept turning page after page, keeping up with the fast paced story in a very anxious mode!!!!The crime scene where the six mummified copses are discovered in the grounds of an abandoned Massachusetts mental asylum felt so scary, real, gruesome and frightening \u2013 I could sense the violence that happened to the victims, their pain \u2013 and so so creepy that I just wanted to get out of there. Talk about panic\u2026and does Lisa Gardner do this so well. I like that there was a romantic build-up between Annabelle and Bobby in the suspense filled time whilst searching for the answers to this complex tale.Such a character driven story \u2013 I engaged so quickly with the new appearances and enjoyed getting to know more about the ones from the previous book. I found it really difficult to put this book down and the ending was absolutely stunning and nothing like I expected. If you want romance and suspense and kept on the seat of your chair, then read this book. Synopsis: You have good reason to be afraid. . . . It was a case that haunts Bobby Dodge to this day\u2014the case that nearly killed him and changed his life forever. Now, in an underground chamber on the grounds of an abandoned Massachusetts mental hospital, the gruesome discovery of six mummified corpses resurrects his worst nightmare: the return of a killer he thought dead and buried. There\u2019s no place to run. . . . Bobby\u2019s only lead is wrapped around a dead woman\u2019s neck. Annabelle Granger has been in hiding for as long as she can remember. Her childhood was a blur of new cities and assumed identities. But what\u2014or who\u2014her family was running from, she never knew. Now a body is unearthed from a grave, wearing a necklace bearing Annabelle\u2019s name, and the danger is too close to escape. This time, she\u2019s not going to run. You know he will find you. . . . The new threat could be the dead psychopath\u2019s copycat, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2014or something far more terrifying. Dodge knows the only way to find him is to solve the mystery of Annabelle Granger, and to do that he must team up with his former lover, partner, and friend D. D. Warren from the Boston P.D. But the trail leads back to a woman from Bobby\u2019s past who may be every bit as dangerous as the new killer\u2014a beautiful survivor-turned-avenger with an eerie link to Annabelle. From its tense opening pages to its shocking climax, Hide is a thriller that delves into our deepest, darkest fears. Where there is no one to trust. Where there is no place left to hide."}, {"userName": "Lis Carey", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey", "userReview": "On the grounds of the now-defunct Boston State Mental Hospital, an underground chamber containing the bodies of six young girls is found. One of the bodies has a locket with a name engraved on it--Annabelle Granger.Annabelle Granger, now living in the North End, building up her own small window treatments business, is not as startled as one might expect by the news of her own death, but she is very alarmed. She's been living in hiding and on the run since the day in 1982 when her parents packed their family belongings into five suitcases, put them in the car, and drove away from their Arlington, MA home forever.As Boston Detective Sargent D.D. Warren and Mass. State Homicide Detective Bobby Dodge try to identify their six victims and puzzle out the possible connection to an earlier case, also involving a kidnapped young girl held captive in an underground chamber, Tanya/Annabelle tries to figure out who her father realy was, and why he kept them on the move, changing names and cities every couple of years. Why he started, when she was just seven years old, schooling her in the basics of self-protection and self-defense, of evading and resisting possible kidnappers.And the more she learns, the more confused and alarmed she becomes. Was her father the loving, protective parent she remembers, or was he someone else, someone much scarier?This is a very tightly plotted mystery, keeping the reader guessing all the way, sharing Annabelle's confusion and bewilderment, and the frustration of Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren as they attempt to find the killer. I was on the edge of my seat all through the story. Character development is also excellent, especially for Annabelle and Bobby Dodge, but also for lesser characters, including Charlie Martin, as well as the parents of Annabelle's girlhood best friend.Recommended.I borrowed this book from the library."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2065514-michael", "userReview": "Mass. State Police Detective Bobby Dodge is called to the scene of a gruesome mass murder that took place on the grounds of the old State Mental Hospital. Six bodies of children are found in an underground chamber in a crime that appears to have taken place over twenty five years ago.One body is tentatively identified by a chain around her neck with the name Annabelle Granger. However, a woman who read about the bodies being discovered, tells the police that she is Annabelle and when she was seven she gave the locket to her friend, Dori Petracelli.Annabelle bears a striking resemblance to another woman who was abducted as a child and placed in an underground chamber. However, hunters heard the girls cries and rescued her. She testified against the man who placed her in the chamber and that man was in prison when the mass murders took place.The investigation moves to the Mental Hospital and prior patients. Two men seem to fit the profile of someone who might be capable of such a crime. We learn what these men did to be placed in the mental hospital and why the authorities would like to find them and question them further.Bobby and Det. D.D. Warren decide that Annabelle may have been the target of a sexual preditor and her parents were worried about this so they moved away and kept moving every few years.Lisa Gardner creates suspense as if she were a chef, putting the ingredients together for a feast. The momentum increases as we progress through this well plotted story. In addition, the author provides a surprise toward the novel's conclusion which was excellently described and perfectly logical. Annabelle was a sympathetic, likable character, who grew in confidence through the story. The antagonist was wee portrayed but the reader will have to learn why by exploring this fine story.Highly recommended."}], "description": "Annabelle Granger has spent her life on the run, her childhood a blur of new places and fresh aliases.
