I always say I have, probably because I want to believe that (and anyway, we all do it), but not every book is great and not every great book is exceptional. I want exceptional. Give me exceptional. Kate DiCamillo\u2019s The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane is just that. It tells the story of little china bunny Edward Tulane who knows not what love means. He is loved by a little girl, and yet, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s self-centered and vain. But little Edward Tulane will discover what love means the way we all do: through loss\u2026 through life. The writing is simply delightfully lyrical. Is lyrical writing always delightful? Not quite, sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. One must master the technique fairly well to pull it off. I used to think children\u2019s books were so, so easy to write (\u2018\u2018anyone could write them!\u2019\u2019) but now that I\u2019ve read a hundred of them and more, I realize that is not the case. Otherwise they would all be bestsellers. This is, without a single, lonely doubt, my most favourite Kate DiCamillo book. It\u2019s also the one with the highest ratings on Goodreads, so I\u2019m happy to see other people were positively, beautifully affected by this novel like I was. I think Kate DiCamillo can do no wrong, but she really surpassed herself with this one.

Edward's journey is miraculous in that the little china rabbit from which the book gets its name learns to love out of his many losses, which starts with losing his straw hat and ends with losing his hardened heart. Take the velveteen rabbit, make him more fragile by making him the China rabbit, put in Kate DiCamillo's voice behind every word, and you have a new classic for children. \"I'm done with being loved,\" Edward told her. \"I'm done with loving. It's too painful.\" . . .  \"Open your heart,\" she said gently. \"Someone will come. Someone will come for you. But first you must open your heart.\" The door closed. The sunlight disappeared.Someone will come. Edward's heart stirred. He thought, for the first time in a long time, of the house on Egypt Street and of Abilene winding his watch and then bending toward him and placing it on his left leg, saying, \"I will come home to you.\" No, no, he told himself. Don't believe it. Don't let yourself believe it. But it was too late.Someone will come for you. The China rabbit's heart had begun, again, to open.That's not the end of the story, but it is such an important passage for so many people to read. I needed to read it the other day when I sat there in Borders once again, tearing up. I'll need to read it again someday, maybe soon. And I think it's worth it for most anyone to take 30 minutes at the most, sit down, and read about how a China rabbit learns to love. And then learns to love again."}, {"userName": "KristenR", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810660-kristenr", "userReview": "What a beautiful story. I read it with my 8 year old daughter and more than once it brought a tear to my eye. It is the story of Edward Tulane, the china rabbit, who while passing from owner to owner (companions really, as he comes to love them) endures great love and great tragedy.

This is the story of a china rabbit who learns the true meaning of love. I read this book out loud to my class and truly enjoyed the masterful way that Kate DiCamillo crafts a story. Her word choice and sentence fluency found its way into my writing lesson plans to illustrate some of the possibilities waiting to be found in words. Would I read it aloud again? Perhaps with older students. My class LOVED this story but it was sad, extremely sad in places. I fought back tears while reading and had to let it sit for awhile before reviewing it because it dealt with some tough material. (Losing people you love.) Initially, I thought I would not recommend it nor read it again because it was just too strong. However, the more I considered this, the more I realized that to not recommend this book would be to make the same mistake that Edward made, and that is to refuse to experience something wonderful just because it can also be hard. So I do recommend it - I do! The lessons learned by Edward apply to us all. Just consider keeping a box of tissues close by."}, {"userName": "Roya", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12222982-roya", "userReview": "You'd think I wouldn't cry after the third read, but all I can say is that I'm glad I skipped the eye makeup today..."}, {"userName": "Sylvia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486347-sylvia", "userReview": "When a friend told me she was reading this book with her 3 and 5 year old kids, I immediately questioned whether they found it too sad. I purchased this book soon after its initial publication and had read it myself at that time. My recollection was that it brought me to tears, and as I have two quite sensitive little boys, I was hesitant to introduce this one to them. Inspired by my friends successful reading of it with her two (slightly) younger children, I bravely undertook this venture - for it was really me I was worried about being able to \"handle\" it. I was not able to hold back the tears as the story drew to a close, but my two beautiful boys wiped them away and assured me that there was nothing to be sad about, and I got the opportunity (one that seems to present itself quite often lately) to explain how tears can come from happiness as much as from sadness.

Do American children books usually refer to the the joys of a sweet melancholy feeling at the lose of something good that will never return? How do children relate to depressed characters? Do they even notice it? Why aren't more children books filled with melancholy, and not in a humorous way? While the sun beat down on my bench, and the film crew near the fountain apparently were also on lunch from filming what looked like a 'dancing in the streets' movie, and the girl sitting the next bench over was losing in a battle of wits against a pigeon who was not going to be fooled into giving up the cracker she dropped I thought about these things. Then I came home and read this book. This book is to the Moomins as finding yourself laying in bed staring at the ceiling at 3am realizing that half your life is over all the good things are past and only pain and regret are ahead of you and having a slightly sad tinged memory of a something wonderful in the past that you will never be able to return to. There is something devastating about this story, and the whole format of the book, from the typesetting and font used to the color of the pages used in the book and the illustrations all work in a harmony to create this strong affect. I'm not sure how kids would react to this, I think from a child's perspective they would only see a story that kind of follows a kind of familiar pattern they are already familiar with. They might find it kind of sad, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Or maybe it will depress them and turn them at a young age to the happy joys of reading literature filled with despair."}, {"userName": "Bach Tran Quang", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9069989-bach-tran-quang", "userReview": "Nh\u1eefng h\u00f4m n\u00e0o m\u1ec7t m\u1ecfi, \u1ed1m, c\u0103ng th\u1eb3ng t\u00f4i s\u1ebd l\u00f4i trong t\u1ee7 s\u00e1ch c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh ra m\u1ed9t cu\u1ed1n s\u00e1ch d\u00e0nh cho thi\u1ebfu nhi \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ecdc.

It tells the story of a china rabbit named Edward, who is nothing more than a toy in the beginning. A much-loved toy, but he doesn't seem capable of any feeling himself, other than annoyance when he is not treated as he thinks he deserves to be treated. I really did not like Edward at first, he was just so cold-hearted!But this book is about growth. The journey is both actual and metaphysical. During his wanderings Edward has many experiences which teach him about friendship, love, hope and happiness: he spends time with an adorable old woman and her husband, then with a hobo, then with a little girl who is ill but who cuddles him like a baby and melts his heart.The transitions between each stage of the journey are difficult for Edward, but he does finally arrive exactly where he belongs, in a perfect misty-eyed ending that I should have expected but didn't. I loved the color illustrations, showing Edward in all his glory during each phase of his journey. By the end of the story I loved Edward as if he were my very own. And I can't help it, I will just have to read it again before I put it back in the bookcase."}, {"userName": "Cassandra, Mother of Satyrs", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56840192-cassandra-mother-of-satyrs", "userReview": "This is such a beautiful book, I remember reading it as a child and not quite understanding it's meaning, but I still enjoyed it.

Oh, but it was exquisitely and simultaneously joyful and sad. Maggie even asked me later last night, after we had finished the book and she was getting ready to brush her teeth, \"Why do people write about sad things, Mom?\" Ah - innocence slips away in small parcels. Then again, when I read her The Velveteen Rabbit, B actually came running into the room to find out what was the matter because she was so distraught. This equally touching story of a china rabbit is affecting. There is a wonderfully taught fairy tale in the midst of the story, and DiCamillo does not hesitate to leave sadness hanging in the air, strings untied, mean circumstances uncured, and yet somehow comes around to a happy ending. We all hope for the happy ending, but I am more encouraged by one that is imperfect because it is ultimately more believable. It is very readable, and the illustrations are quite nice. It moves quickly, and at Maggie's age it is exciting when you pass page 100 or 150 because it feels like a great novelty. However, if you do not have access to an interested and astute little one to read this to, there is charm to be found in it for everyone. I had to hold back tears when I was reading the last few chapters...and that almost never happens to me.

LewisThe Chronicles of Narnia.I read this book aloud with my 7 yr old son. I think Kate DiCamillo is a special writer because she can write about china rabbits being loved by little girls and my son shifts quickly from soft pillow to sitting up rapt waiting for what comes next.I cannot wait to read another of her books. I was in rapt attention myself.This is the story of a china rabbit who is loved by a little girl named Abilene. Edward is well-dressed, has his own pocket watch, gets to sit at the table with the family and thinks quite a lot of himself. He was purchased for Abilene by her grandmother, Pellegrina.One night Pellegrina tells Abilene a story about a princess that is quite full of herself and who is not interested in loving others. The message is not lost on Edward, especially when the woman leans over his bed and says to him \"You disappoint me.\"Fate takes Edward in and out of the lives of many who love him and slowly but surely he begins to understand what Pellegrina was alluding to with her story so long ago.I cried again, when I told my husband all about it. This was a really great book. The illustrations were lovely as well and really captured the quiet, endearing, enduring feel of this book.The story is appropriate for someone as young as 5 or 6, but some of the vocabulary is a bit large.

When I read those stories in my distant youth, they spoke to me. Now, I fear, if I re-read them, I might suspect that the author was deliberately playing with my emotions. Even though I know that authors, do exactly that to make a point.What charmed me about this book was having it read to me in 20 minute segments at night by one of my grand children. And seeing how the book spoke to her much-less-jaded heart, and how she rejoiced in the ending. And hearing the beauty of the 'story telling voice' in this book that does not shrink from a sophisticated vocabulary in choosing the right word over the simpler word.So, this book was a 3 star for me, and 5 star for the child who read it to me.

And once again I am in awe of Kate DiCamillo. Her stories are timeless, beautifully written, magical and filled with memorable moments and memorable characters. I often think people underestimate how hard it is to write for children, because let's face it, a really good piece of children's literature not only has to win over its target audience but also has to appeal to adults.

The previously obscure \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d has been propelled to the upper reaches of the Korean book chart for several weeks by a somewhat unlikely association. \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d plays a key role in the highly popular K-drama \u201cMy Love From the Stars\u201d which was voted Korea\u2019s favorite program earlier this year. The premise of \u201cMy Love From the Stars\u201d centers around an alien who landed in Korea during the Joseon period and who has been living here for the past 400 years. Cursed and blessed with a perfect physical appearance that never ages (embodied by heart throb actor Kim Soo-hyun), he has to change his identity every 10 years to avoid his alien nature being discovered. That is until the present day when he rather inconveniently falls in love with the country\u2019s most famous hallyu (Korean wave) actress. Throughout the story, the mysterious alien claims that \u201cEdward Tulane\u201d is a reflection of his own life as well as his key to understanding human emotion and experience.It is easy to see why this otherworldly visitor would be charmed by \u201cEdward Tulane.\u201d DiCamillo\u2019s appealing tale tells the life story of a haughty, vain and prideful china rabbit \u2013 the eponymous Edward. Edward\u2019s story begins in the 1930\u2019s when he is given as a birthday present to Abilene; an adoring ten year old girl who loves Edward unconditionally. The china rabbit\u2019s arrogant disposition however prevents him from appreciating this care and affection. Edward\u2019s life soon changes when he is lost on a family trip. From then on, he is acquired and lost by a variety of owners, some of whom treat him with kindness and some who are cruelly inconsiderate. As Edward travels with the fishermen and hoboes he encounters, he slowly loses his pride, coming to realize that \u201cif you have no intention of loving or being loved, then the whole journey is pointless.\u201d \u201cThe Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\u201d is tinged with a melancholic magic and its seemingly whimsical nature hides deep reserves of sadness.

Elegant, pampered, and hopelessly vain, Edward lives a luxurious life adored by a little girl named Abilene. But then one day Edward becomes a lost toy, and begins a long and incredible journey in an attempt to be found.This is the last in the Kate DiCamillo boxed set we bought a while ago, and I can easily say it's my favorite book of hers that I've read to date. Despereaux and Winn-Dixie are sweet and artistic, but this book is a masterpiece. Part parable, part allegory, this isn't the most original story ever, but I didn't care in the slightest that it was a little unrealistic and predictable and sounded like stories I'd heard told before. The journey was such a delight (though undeniably melancholy at times) that I tore through it and was sorry when it ended. Edward's vignette-like travels were each unique and illustrative, and I loved how he met so many different types of people who all treated him so differently, but each taught him something along the way. They didn't shy away from the sadness of life, but there was always a purpose, and it was treated very gently. I really felt like I was reading something much bigger and more profound than a children's story about a lost rabbit. The writing feels effortless but effective, and very honest, which is SO refreshing in modern children's literature. I can't possibly imagine that the author didn't intend to make this book have so much depth in its message, but if she didn't, I'm glad that she wrote it how she did whatever her intention. I could honestly go on and on about this book, but I feel like my words aren't really enough to give it the praise it deserves, so I'll just say that I really enjoyed it, and sometimes even just thinking about the Coda makes me start to cry. I can't wait to read this with my kids one day.(At the risk of sounding pithy, the best comparison I can think of for this experience is watching Toy Story 3 for the first time, and trying to understand how that movie/this book could make me feel SO much.)This book completely lives up to its title -- it is a miracle. I am not at all ashamed to admit that I cried. A few times. And sometimes I cry just thinking about it. Yes. It's brilliant. It's sometimes sad, but it's so sincere I could hardly stand it. THANK YOU, Kate DiCamillo, for writing genuine children's literature. This is a marvelous, melancholy masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Arminzerella", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella", "userReview": "Edward Tulane is a china rabbit, commissioned specially for Abilene Tulane by her grandmother, and he\u2019s one vain bunny. He spends most of his time admiring himself and the fine figure he cuts in his custom-made silk suits. Abilene\u2019s grandmother seems to know Edward\u2019s thoughts are only for himself, for she warns him that without love, he will never be happy. And when Edward is tossed overboard by a couple of kids when he and Abilene are on a cruise he comes to know the truth of it. For the first time in his life Edward is alone and his beautiful clothes are ruined. He finally starts paying attention to something other than himself. His life, then, changes dramatically and he meets (and loves) a number of other people. First there are a fisherman and his wife, who adore Edward, make him new clothes, talk to him. But their horrible daughter throws him in a trash heap. Then, a hobo and his dog find and adopt him and he becomes their traveling companion. When they are discovered in an empty boxcar, however, he is thrown into the woods. Later, he is discovered by a little boy, who takes him home to his sister \u2013 a very sick little girl. Eventually, she dies and Edward and the boy \u2013 miserable over her death - travel to the city to make their fortune. Edward nearly meets his end there, when an angry restaurant owner breaks him. But he is saved by a toy-maker, who carefully repairs him. He comes full circle when Abilene\u2019s own daughter comes into the shop and chooses him.This story felt manipulative. Edward is not very likable initially, but his traumatic experiences change him. And then it\u2019s just one horrible thing after another, with me sitting on the edge of my chair waiting for him to break. People were needlessly cruel to him, to one another. And it just left me irritated. Kate DiCamillo is also the author of Because of Winn-Dixie, which is such a wonderful book. This just doesn\u2019t touch it. It was disappointingly shallow, with Edward set up to learn a hard and harsh lesson through much adversity and abuse. Great. Beat up the bunny. Make people out to be either good or evil but never a bit of both. Good thing it\u2019s short.

This whopper of a book was 200 pages of masterful writing with gorgeous illustrations. I loved everything about this perfect story of a lost toy but what I loved the most was the intricate way that the language of this story was handled. The rabbit thought quite a lot of himself and that was evident in his choice of words...you could read how he felt about himself in the things he said and the way he said them. The language was a little high for children but made the story so enjoyable for the reader.Aside from this beautiful love affair with the English language was this lovely, lovely story about the redeeming quality of love...accepting love, suffering love, and healing through love. I was literally incapable of reading the final page aloud and that was the second time in the book that I was choking back tears.
