Though my heart is always with these stories, they've often lacked style. Viet Nguyen has style. He's really funny, in a smart unpredictable way. And I think he's is going to get a lot of awards and all that when word really gets out. Deservedly so because it touches all the big points of Vietnamese American history while never getting bogged down in being a historical lesson. I can see backlash by Vietnamese conservatives who want us all to just be the kind of Vietnamese who do our homework and forever hold a grudge against Communism. Definitely, not a read for the faint-hearted. I'd say this is the best book on the Vietnamese American experience period. And coming from a Vietnamese American who was actually a boat refugee, this is the most authentic (yea, it's spy genre, but we're talking how Vietnamese people actually think and survive) telling of the Vietnam to America experience. I'm buying this as a gift for all the cool people in my family."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Another Update (2nd update)--- I've been reading through my Kindle book again the last few days of this book --looking over my notes -taking new ones.--Our local book club is meeting to talk about \"The Sympathizer\". 25 of members from around the Bay Area are attending....with 25 others on the waitlist. For people who live in our area -- this is an important topic. Americans and Vietnamese/Americans live closely together here. The Vietnamese culture thrives in our city. Right after I read this book -the first time -over a year ago --before Viet won the Pulitzer Prize --I chatted with him....a few times actually. He lived here in San Jose for a period of his life--and still has relatives in San Jose. What stands out for me -this second time -- (especially the parts in Los Angles when things looked so awful to me in those grimy apartments -yet I couldn't help but laugh at some of the descriptions) -- was that Viet didn't write this book to point any fingers. He never 'blames' anyone - but we become more aware of the conflicts living in the minds of the Vietnamese 'just-being-here' after the war in Vietnam. And nobody gave us that experience more clearly than he has in any book I had read before. Looking forward to what 24 other people have to say! Update: exciting news.... This book just won the Pulitzer Prize for this year!!!!!!!!!!!!! VERY EXCITING!!!! VERY Cool!!!!The year is 1975 at the start. As communist tanks are about to roll into Saigon,a General of the Southern Vietnamese army is saying good-bye to community workers and friends from the Villa they live.The General and his and compatriots leave to start a new life in Los Angeles, Calif. The Captain 'secretly' reports to a communist-allied -higher up - Viet Cong. about their group. Both secrecy and hierarchy were key to revolution ---which was why there was always another committee higher up! The author's story gives voice -depth- anguish -and understanding of what its like to be Vietnamese in America after the war. The narrator, *The grizzled captain*, brings us into his head so that in time, we, too, feel as if we have one foot in American and one foot in Vietnam. .....\"Ah, the Amerasian, forever caught between worlds and never knowing where he belongs! Imagine if you did not suffer from the confusion you must constantly experience, feeling the constant tugof-war inside you and over you, between Orient and Occident. 'East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet', as Kipling so accurately diagnosed\". There are enchanting growth experiences for our 'grizzled-captain' with woman! I especially loved how his eyes opened when he was falling in love with Lana: A modern thinking Vietnamese woman. \"She believed in gun control, birth control, liberation for homosexuals and civil rights for all; she believed in Ghandi, Martin Luthur King Jr., and Thich Nhat Hanh; she believed in nonviolence, and world peace, and yoga.....\" \"Most of all this woman expressed her opinions: whereas most Vietnamese woman kept their opinions to themselves until they were married, whereon they never kept their opinions to themselves, she was not hesitant to say what she thought.\" This is a remarkable first novel. Its 'RICH & LIVELY'. Packed filled with stories -thrilling -thriller-funny & fierce! Its a novel which commands our compassion and respect for Vietnamese-Americans.I've 'shifted' in 'soul' since reading this book. It gives me an entire new view of the ending of the Vietnam War. Bringing Vietnam and America together has been taking shape in front of my eyes for years -- but I hadn't examined the courage, suffering, heroism, and collaboration until now. My emotional heart is permanently tattooed with love for the Vietnamese-Americans. I share a city with a large population of Vietnamese-Americans. I live in San Jose, California. We have more Vietnamese residents than any other city outside of Vietnam. Over 10% of our population is comprised with Vietnamese-American residents. Our city has Vietnamese language radio shows, TV shows, literature, community strip malls. (Vietnam Town). The San Jose City Council designated Vietnam Town as \"Little Saigon\". Most Vietnamese prefer the name Vietnam Town. We've wonderful services run by the Vietnamese: nail salons, acupuncture, clothing, furniture, jewelry, accounting, travel, medical, and wonderful restaurants,(Pho soup), etc. This is a powerful book! Hard to believe it has not been written until now! Wonderful engaging storytelling by Viet Thanh Nguyen.Thank you Grove Atlantic and Netgalley!

Our narrator, the Captain , a double agent, introduces the reader to his dual allegiance when he says \" I am simply able to see any issue from both sides. I flatter myself that this is a talent...\" I was reminded of the mixed feelings that people had about this war. I was very moved by some of the scenes. The old woman and others angry and grieving throwing their shoes . Also heartbreaking was how the Captain's friend Bon loses his wife and child. In addition to the chaos of the evacuation scene the gut wrenching torture scenes towards the end stands out in my mind as well.The essay and an interview at the end of the book were also enlightening and so very relevant for the issues at hand today and gave me a better understanding of the novel. In the essay , the author says : \"The tendency to separate war stories from immigrant stories means that most Americans don't understand how many of the immigrants and refugees in the United States have fled from wars - many of which this country has had a hand in.\" But he doesn't put the full blame there . In the interview, he says : \" The Vietnamese are at least partially responsible for what they did to themselves. I didn't want to put the blame squarely on the Americans or the French, although that blame is there. I wanted this to be ver specifically a moment of Vietnamese-on-Vietnamese confrontation and responsibility because, again, this is in part how we claim our subjectivity: we aren't just victims but victimizers as well. This is a part of our history that we all find very hard to confront.\" These comments give the novel some perspective and I wish I had read them first. The wonderful writing I found in The Refugees prompted me to read this book. If that wasn't reason enough, this was a buddy read with two of my very good Goodreads friends, Diane and Esil. However, I have very mixed feelings about the book. There were too few moments when I felt an emotional connection to the Captain and at times it was a struggle to continue reading. I wish I could articulate it in a better way, but there you have it . 3 stars and 3.5 stars after reading the essay and interview, but these were not the novel, so it remains 3 stars. It won the Pulitzer Prize and there are so many others who have rated it 5 stars, but it just didn't get to me as much as The Refugees which I rated 5 stars. Thanks , Diane and Esil! Let's do this again sometime."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Pulitzer Prize winner and I don't always agree, and such is the case here. A very worthy book, a book with so many truisms, such as this one \"booted hard by the irony of how revolution fought for independence and freedom could make those things worth less than nothing.\" The tone is ironic, often satirical but it gets to be too much, wearing on me as I was reading. Almost became a chore to shift through some of this to get to the parts that meant something to me. I little remember the Vietnam War, was very young but do remember the scenes on TV and the protests all over the United States. So in this way the book did succeed by showing me many of the things I didn't know. There are brilliant phrases, insights but in between were things I just wasn't interested in, that in a way felt like it was taking away from the story. Though in retrospect I can see where it all ties together, what it means, but while reading it just felt frustrating. There is one event I found shocking, interesting, comes near the end of the book but again I felt this was overplayed, went on too long. So a very mixed read for me, intellectually I can see why it won, but emotionally I wasn't sold. The absurdities of war and we keep going round and round, never learning a thing, or so it seems.Buddy read with Angela and Esil, which definitely made this easier to bear, would probably never had finished if it hadn't been for them."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Forty years ago this month, after a long, deadly release of flatulence from American politicians, the United States evacuated its personnel from Saigon in an operation appropriately code-named Frequent Wind.

Perhaps not surprisingly, I am also a man of two minds. With these words Viet Thanh Nguyen decides to start the novel and these two sentences were enough to get me hooked. They managed to intrigue me, to want to know more and set the basis for what will prove to be one of the main theme, the interior conflict of the narrator. The Symphatizer is a book about the Vietnam War and its aftermath. The book is about loyalty, identity and the difficulty to adjust to a new culture and reality. It written from the point of view of the Vietnamese and does not always put the Americans in a positive light. This novel is a perfect companion to the Quiet American by Graham Green (a masterpiece ), the only other book about the Vietnam war that I read. Actually, the Quiet American is mentioned a couple of times in the Symphatizer. One theme that I found in both books is about the \u201cinnocent\u201d and idealized intentions with which the Americans entered the Vietnam War and their failure to admit ant wrongdoing.  \u201cThey believe in a universe of divine justice where the human race is guilty of sin, but they also believe in a secular justice where human beings are presumed innocent. You can\u2019t have both. You know how Americans deal with it? They pretend they are eternally innocent no matter how many times they lose their innocence. The problem is that those who insist on their innocence believe anything they do is just. At least we who believe in our own guilt know what dark things we can do.\u201d  A similar idea I selected for my review of the Quiet American: \"Innocence is a kind of insanity\u201d \u201cInnocence always calls mutely for protection when we would be so much wiser to guard ourselves against it: innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.\u201d The novel kept me on the edge of the seat for the first 100 pages or so when the fall of Saigon is described and thorough the escape to USA of the main characters. When the setting moves to Los Angeles the pace slows down and my interest begins to gradually fall culminating with the making of the movie in Thailand. Those chapters were excruciatingly slow and the smart writing barely managed to make the experience bearable. My interest picked up after that and the last 20% of the book were as good as the beginning. I do not want to say too much about that except that it was the most disturbing part of the novel. The book is cleverly written, I loved the author\u2019s way with words. I did not expect to find humor among these pages, even less one similar to Vonnegut\u2019s ( a realization I had while reading another review). I noticed a particularity of the writing style that I want to share with you. The author uses a lot of sexual metaphors when describing war scenes. Here are two examples:  \u201cstubby grenades resembling short, metallic dildos\u201d  and \u201da parachute flare sputtering into spermating existence\u201d . I wonder what the meaning behind them is. Is it because war, as sex is about power, control, performance and status? Is it because the two acts dehumanize us to some extent? In the end I also want to let you all know that I will never look at a squid the same way ever again. The ones that read the novel know why."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "If you ever struggle with your feelings and understanding about America\u2019s role in the Vietnam War, this book could give you a useful framework to both widespread blaming and forms of forgiveness to both sides. There really was no right side to be on, and the Vietnamese people became a pawns in a larger struggle: Our country itself was cursed, bastardized, partitioned into north and south, and if it could be said of us that we chose division and death in our uncivil war, that was also only partially true. We had not chosen to be debased by the French, to be divided by them into an unholy trinity of north, center, and south, and to be turned over to the great powers of capitalism and communism for a further bisection, then given roles as the clashing armies of a Cold War chess match played in air-conditioned rooms by white men wearing suits and lies.With this story we get a rare, authentic Vietnamese perspective here that delves masterfully into the large questions of identity in the context of nationalism, race, culture, and morality. Written by a Vietnamese immigrant, this Pulitzer Prize winning book is incredibly ambitious and often challenging to read. It\u2019s hard to identify with the slippery duality of the narrator, who served as a communist spy within the South Vietnamese republic and continues to do so while in America. His intellectual and sardonic tone creates an ongoing barrier in the reader\u2019s emotional engagement with his fate. Yet, this approach was very effective to lead me to begin to see everything about this hot spot for the superpower\u2019s Cold War in many shades of gray rather than an unrealistic black and white. In an interview published at the end of the hardback, Nguyen usefully explains some of his goal with the book:  I did not want to write this book as a way of explaining the humanity of Vietnamese. Toni Morrison says in Beloved that to have to explain yourself to white people distorts you because you start from a position of assuming your inhumanity or lack of humanity in other people\u2019s eyes. Rather than writing a book that tries to affirm humanity, which is typically the position that minority writers are put into, the book starts from the assumption that we are human, and then goes on to prove that we\u2019re also inhuman at the same time.The story begins in the middle and works alternatingly backward and forward. We start with the life of this \u201csleeper\u201d agent who has recently immigrated to California after the fall of Saigon 1975. The narration has the flavor of both justification and confession. We only know him as the \u2018captain\u2019, his rank as an aide to the general commanding the South Vietnam secret police, with whom he fled with the relatively small fraction of natives loyal to the Americans. His conflicted persona has early origins in his life as an offspring of a French priest and peasant Vietnamese girl, earning him lifelong revulsion and mistrust as a bastard. He has chosen a path set by the communists seeking freedom and independence from all colonialists, and his role of spy in the midst of his countrymen on the side of the American aggressors suits his chameleon character. The pompous Oriental studies professor for whom he works as a menial assistant puts forth a theory that for him to balance the Asian and Western traits in his character will make him especially valuable for the collective effort to forge a way for East and West to coexist. While in many ways reviling his Western half, the idea of him being a one-man \u201cmelting pot\u201d aligns with his mother\u2019s mantra to him: \u201cRemember, you're not half of anything, you're twice of everything\u201d. My weakness for sympathizing with others has much to do with my status as a bastard, which is not to say that being a bastard naturally predisposes one to sympathy. Many bastards behave like bastards, and I credit my gentle mother with teaching me the idea that blurring the lines between us and them can be a worthy behavior.The captain truly does sympathize with the general in his integrity and honest choice to fight the communists. He admires the general\u2019s efforts to get everyone who served with him out of country in the tragic chaos of the last days before total takeover of Saigon. We get a harrowing narrative of those last days, including the death of his best friend\u2019s family. The caption also shares in the exiles\u2019 sense of alienation and depression as they struggle to adapt to life in America. The ordinary Americans understand so little of what they have been through or what their blundering under na\u00efve idealism has wreaked on their country (\u201cNo one asks poor people if they want war\u201d). When the captain was an exchange student in the U.S. in high school, he didn\u2019t feel this alienated, as it was natural to be treated as an exotic foreigner. Now it is easy to identify with the general trying not to succumb to despair over the loss of his county. Others do not do so well,\u2026a fair percentage collecting both welfare and dust, moldering in the stale air of subsidized apartments as their testes shriveled day by day, consumed by the metastasizing cancer called assimilation and susceptible to the hypochondria of exile.Our protagonist also empathizes with the general\u2019s daughter Lana, who embraces the wild life of the youth culture in California, going so far as to perform in skimpy dress with a musical group. Our captain is too human to resist her charms:I quietly quaffed my cognac, discreetly admiring Lana's legs. Longer than the Bible and a hell of a lot more fun, they stretched forever, like an Indian yogi or an American highway shimmering through the Great Plains or the southwestern desert. Her legs demanded to be looked at and would not take no, non, nein, nyet, or even maybe for an answer.Eventually, out captain gets drawn into the evolution of plans to lead an insurgency against the communist victors using resources of sympathetic right-wing Americans (shade of the \u201cBay of Pigs\u201d incursion by expatriate Cubans). And this is exactly his job, to monitor and report in coded communications such counter-revolutionary activity to his handler. It\u2019s so eerie how good our protagonist\u2019s work is as a double agent, all founded on his human capacity to sympathize with others. But over and over in this tale we get this message:A person\u2019s strength was always his weakness, and vice versa.He suffers when in the course of serving the general he has to participate in the elimination of exiles suspected of being communist agents. Back in Saigon, when he had to participate, even indirectly, in the torture of suspected Viet Cong for his work with the secret police, he was doubly guilty when the victim was a legitimate agent, and he could do nothing to intervene without blowing his cover.This read totally twists you up. The career of a double agent is so far from the life of a true believer on either side of a conflict. As a reader, the beginnings of empathy for this deceptive character comes when he is tormented by the experience of ghosts of the innocent who die as collateral damage from his career. At one point he gets to act with a purpose in unity with both the communist and anticommunist drivers in his life: a service as an advisor to a movie director in the process of making a film along the lines of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d, i.e. \u201can epic about white men saving good yellow people from bad yellow people\u201d, one \u201cwhere the losers would write history instead of the victors, courtesy of the most efficient propaganda machine ever created.\u201d When asked to review the script for authenticity with respect to Vietnamese culture, our captain is affronted that there is no speaking part for a Vietnamese character:In this forthcoming Hollywood trompe d\u2019oeil, all the Vietnamese of any side would come out poor, herded into the roles of the poor, the innocent, the evil, or the corrupt. Our fate was not to be merely mute; we were to be struck dumb.Quite a worthwhile section of this book is devoted to our protagonist\u2019s efforts to work with the the Vietnamese extras from the exile community at the filming location in the Philippines. This was the best part of the book for me. The parts the arrogant \u201cauteur\u201d puts into the film for Vietnamese characters ends up being ones of incredible brutality of the Vietnamese against each other, with Americans retaining hero status on the side. Not exactly what our captain wanted, but a fair allegory of the war itself. The mirror held up for American readers like me can be pretty powerful. For my own history I dodged the draft by raising my blood pressure and participated in anti-war actions like the big march on Washington, yet was taken aback with shame over Jane Fonda\u2019s friendly confab with Ho Chi Minh and with our ultimate failure to stop the dominoes falling. No hand-washing can clean our guilt, but as a nation, we shrugged it all off:Americans are a confused people because they can't admit this contradiction. They believe in a universe of divine justice where the human race is guilty of sin, but they also believe in a secular justice where human beings are presumed innocent.You know how Americans deal with it? They pretend they are eternally innocent no matter how many times they lose their innocence. The problem is that those who insist on their innocence believe anything they do is just. At least we who believe in our own guilt know what dark things we can do.The story is brought to a dramatic conclusion in a harrowing sections in the end, which I will steer clear of any revelation. The only hint I will give is that we learn why the narrative has the flavor of a confession of sorts. And we understand how our protagonist\u2019s admirable efforts at loyalty both of his two \u201cblood brother\u201d friends from childhood end up contributing of some serious soul rendering, as one serves with the general\u2019s crew and the other is his secret communist handler. I feel this book will stand the test of time as a classic, up there with Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d and Greene\u2019s \u201cThe Quiet American\"."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "The Darkness of DemocracyWhen Donald Trump blasts \"Make America Great Again\", it may not be obvious that 'again' has a very specific historical reference: the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the day the United States lost its first war. This event opens The Sympathizer. The Donald cannot mention Vietnam; it is still too painful and embarrassing a topic in American politics even after more than 40 years. There was no attack on a US ship in the Tonkin Gulf, there were no dominoes waiting to fall, there were no oppressed freedom-loving people to defend. These were fabrications. The Vietnam War in the US has the same emotional significance as the First World War to Germany during the Weimar Republic. It is a reminder of not just defeat, and government deceit but of purported betrayal by one's fellow countrymen - hippies, liberals, draft dodgers, inconstant politicians. The fact that Trump arranged to have himself exempted from being drafted into the Vietnam War - through equivalent fabrication - makes him even more emotionally dedicated to ensuring his own past disappears into that period when America believed itself not just courageous, and honest but competent, and above all exceptional among nations. His recent attack on former Vietnamese prisoner of war John McCain as a 'loser' was not so much personal as a metaphysical rejection of Trump's as well as the country's own history.This novel is acutely prescient not only about the archetypal American/Trumpian neurosis, which it satirises so mercilessly, but also about the political effects of that neurosis. The conflict in Vietnam has become an historical metaphor for what is happening in American politics as I write this review. The route from Weimar to National Socialism in the Germany of the 1930's, as many have already noted, has much the same scenery as the rise of Trump. The similarity is not congenial to many Americans. Nguyen's staging of the problem of America in Vietnam is therefore brilliant. That he doesn't provide a happy d\u00e9nouement is simply prudence not lack of imagination. Many others who have studied the problem reach a similar impasse.For example, in 1943, two weeks before her death, the young philosopher Simone Weil wrote a short essay 'On the Abolition of All Political Parties'. In it she distinguishes the meaning and practice of political parties in continental Europe and the Anglo-Saxon world of America and Britain. Both types involve the passionate espousal of a point of view on the shape and content of the general good. Weil likes neither type - the British because, although it dissipates passions, the result is compromise which everyone can accept but no one really wants. The continental, because it enflames passions to the point where Jacobin ferocity puts \"one party in power and all the others in jail\". Frustration with the former naturally leads to the latter. The slide from reason to controllable passion to Gnostic dictatorship in which each party accuses the other, not only of error but of the vile civil evil of treason is, she implies, inevitable. This she foresees is the real threat of and to democracy: the corruption of the souls and consciences of those who participate in party politics. It is difficult not to perceive in the recently held Republican National Convention precisely this slide from rational perception of one's personal interests to the ultimate demonisation of the other side as perverts, traitors and liars: \"Hillary for Prison\", \"Hillary the Traitor of Benghazi\".The Sympathizer is in large part about Weil's inevitable slide into the abyss of party politics. The locus is not Cleveland (although much of the book takes place in America) and the protagonist is not American (but significantly European/Asian). Nevertheless the not-so-hidden force of the narrative is American culture and American military and political power in the character of the mysterious Claude. One clue to the metaphorical intent of the book is that Claude (and his intellectual avatar Hedd) is apparently the only proper name in the book. The other characters are either roles - the Captain, the General, the Auteur, the Parisian aunt, the crapulent major - or veiled descriptors in languages other than English - Man, Bon, Sofia Mori. What the named character of Claude promotes is simply the creation and the continuing passionate hatred and conflict between the two historical factions of Vietnamese before during and after the war. He plots and meddles and tortures and encourages strife endlessly, not for any obvious ideology or advantage but just because he can. Claude is America and what America does - not just to others but to itself. Not until halfway through the book, despite several hints, does it become apparent that it is actually about representative democracy not Vietnam: \"Not to own the means of production can lead to premature death, but not to own the means of representation is also a kind of death.\" muses the spy-protagonist who is having a rather different kind of political awakening than he anticipated during his life in the West. The real question is how anyone can be politically represented. Neither liberal democracy nor the dictatorship of the proletariat makes a satisfactory solution to the problem. All politics fail from time to time. Perhaps not inevitably as Weil feared, but certainly when it comes under control by the Claudes of the world.Donald Trump is the potentially fatal flaw in American representative democracy. Clearly Nguyen knew nothing of Trump's prospective rise to political fame as he wrote. But he didn't need to. Trump is a type, the dark side of America that lurks constantly in wait to mug the entire country, and as much of the rest of the world that is within reach. It is this dark side which is so obvious to non-Americans, especially non-European non-Americans. And it is this side which Nguyen describes with such horrible accuracy. A timely reminder therefore of the real danger we face."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "My mother was native, my father was foreign, and strangers and acquaintances had enjoyed reminding me of this ever since my childhood, spitting on me and calling me bastard, although sometimes, for variety, they called me bastard before they spit on me.I didn't realize how much I've gotten used to not needing to pay attention to the books I read.

We discussed it last night, and I wanted to wait to weigh in until that discussion, but also until I had finished reading the author's non-fiction book Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War (on the long list for the National Book Award as we speak.)When you read the two books back to back, it is easy to see how the eleven years of research that went into the non-fiction academic treatment of a book on war and memory also provided the natural breeding grounds for a biting novel about the Vietnam War. Or, should I clarify, the war we refer to as the Vietnam War, or even more often, just \"Vietnam.\" And I need to clarify because Nguyen is writing this novel from the Vietnamese perspective, not necessarily catering to what white Americans want to hear. The author claims status as a forever refugee, a product of war, his entire life trajectory a result of having to leave his home as a child. (A curious person can learn even more about the author's perspective in this illuminating interview.)In case it sounds like I am saying this is a didactic novel, I would beg to differ. The different point of view is very effective, but also necessary. Why are we only seeing the story of a war in a country not our own through the lens of war movies we make? (If this topic interests you, definitely read his non-fiction work.) But the entire novel is also slowly revealed as a confession, written by a central unnamed character (I'm guessing his name is Viet) during his time in a Reeducation camp. These camps were real things, and the last 100 pages are a brutal account of psychological and physical torture and brainwashing. So there is the point of view (powerful), the approach (confession), but the greatest element of the novel for me is the writing. Nguyen plays with the English language in a way I haven't seen. I don't think he would claim his background as the reason because he has been in the United States for most of his life, in fact is an English professor, among other duties. But I was constantly amused/surprised by his use of words, taking a word like perineum that is almost inclusively a body part and using it to refer to a time of day that is hidden from view, gross, and better slept through:\"...We followed our usual routine and drank with joyless discipline until we both passed out. I woke up in the perineum of time between the very late hours of the evening and the very early hours of the morning, grotty sponge in my mouth...\"That is an example of me stopping, putting the book aside, looking up the word, asking, \"Do we use that word that way?\", finding we don't, but deciding we should because obviously it works. It is this clever crafting of words that kept me reading, more than the events, more than the unnamed agent antics of the central character (\"a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces....\")I really love the last three pages, but I will leave those for the reader to mull over."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Powerful Personalization of Vietnamese and Vietnam War's Fallout [Winner of 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Literature]This novel profoundly personalized for me the Vietnam War and the Vietnamese in a way no movie or book has. It is written as the first person account of a South Vietnamese captain who was born a \"bastard\" to a Vietnamese mother who was seduced and impregnated by his father, a Catholic priest, who fails to recognize the captain as a son. The narrator/captain is a sympathizer to the communist overthrow of Vietnam (and reports certain activities in southern Calif. in the years after the overthrow), yet no one should get the impression that this tsunamic novel is in some way sympathetic to communism or communists. The idea crossed my mind before reading the book.Author Viet Thanh Nguyen, Assoc. Prof., USCInstead, this novel, full of levity and humor, is a substantial, captivating and intellectually stimulating novel that actualizes, in human terms, an indictment of the USA's treatment of the Vietnamese during and after the war (all here in the States) but it much more harshly denounces communism and the post-revolutionary communist leaders of Vietnam (asking, both implicitly and explicitly, what does the revolutionary do when the revolution triumphs?, and why do those who call for independence and freedom take away the independence and freedom of others?).The Animal Farm will always stick with me on the evils of communism, particularly in Russia. Now The Sympathizer has scarred a slice of my soul with the devastating effects on a country and its countrymen of a communist regime (and makes the point that many of the former revolutionaries saw the error after it was too late). Moreover, the book examines of the more general evils corrupting men/women in power, all ideas of government aside. This novel brings to mind a quote I ran across about a year ago from an Argentine-Canadian man of letters named Alberto Manguel, who so poignantly stated about good literature:  Books may not change our suffering, books may not protect us from evil [or] tell us what is good or what is beautiful, and they will certainly not shield us from the common fate of the grave. But books grant us myriad possibilities: the possibility of change, the possibility of illumination.This novel seems perfect for high school and college students studying the Vietnam War and the era surrounding it, particularly from the point of view of the Vietnamese.

At times hilarious, at others disturbing, and sometimes both at once, this is a story about war, identity, friendship, loyalty and understanding. I'll admit to not having the most extensive understanding of the Vietnam War. It was before my time and if I was ever taught about it in school (I'm sure it had to have come up at some point, right?) it's lost on me now. My background knowledge basically comes from watching Apocalypse Now (which is the obvious inspiration for a movie in the novel to which our narrator lends his perspective) which is hardly an exhaustive resource. After reading, I feel like I can both sympathize with and condemn all of the parties involved in the War. Our nameless narrator is a \"man of two minds\" continuously caught in the middle of several parties. He's half-Vietnamese, half-French, and American by assimilation although none of his countries accept him. Add to that his communist sympathies as a Vietnamese refugee in America, reporting on the goings-on to his superiors who are reading his hidden messages more closely than we realize. I've read plenty of stories where the hero is from multiple worlds without being fully accepted by any of them, but never done more masterfully than in this novel. As the narrator sympathizes with nearly everyone he meets, we can't help but sympathize with the tragedies he experiences, even the ones brought by his own hand.There are shades of Kurt Vonnegut (particularly Mother Night) in the black humor and the clever use of language that is simultaneously profound, provocative, and comical. The author somehow finds a way to use a woman's cleavage as metaphor in such an insightful way it's a little bit embarrassing. He makes light of several events in ways that are just cringe-worthy (squid? coke bottle?) it's hard to read but even harder not to.For a debut author, Viet Than Nguyen is astoundingly assured in his writing. His prose is beyond impressive. The pace is inconsistent and some parts felt like I was slogging through (except for in a few parts, this is hardly the thriller it claims to be) but overall an informative, beautifully written historical novel.

Sometimes, it's hard to find such a quote, whereas in other cases, I find myself having a luxury of choosing from as many as a dozen good quotes that I loved while reading the novel.But with Sympathizer, it's just plain crazy. When I reached the last page of the novel, I looked back at the highlighted lines I saved, and I found myself with over EIGHTY different mesmerizing quotes. And at that moment, the intuition that I've read one of the well-crafted literature written was confirmed for me. \n\u275d My weakness for sympathizing with others has much to do with my status as a bastard, which is not to say that being a bastard naturally predisposes one to sympathy. Many bastards behave like bastards.\u275e\nThe Sympathizer is our unnamed narrator, a US-educated non-combat South Vietnamese military man who is secretly a mole working for Vietcong. (Helluva Resume, My dear unnamed narrator). The story is the written confession of our leading man, penned for his jail keepers. His confession starts with the fall of Saigon in 1975, followed by his immigration to the USA with his commander who is a military General, his friend Bon and other escapees, all while acting as a spy and reporting to his friend in Vietcong. \n\u275d Besides my conscience, my liver was the most abused part of the body.\u275e\nIn many novels, you can feel the author pulling the strings as the story switches characters, POVs or Inner monologues. But With Viet Thanh Nguyen's novel, there is not a single trace of outside influence. The story belongs to the narrator and him alone. This particular style truly made the events, emotions, characters, sentences.... everything complex and full of life.\n\u275d I was in close quarters with some representative specimens of the most dangerous creature in the history of the world, the white man in a suit.\u275e\n  Sympathizer masterly handles a lot of fascinating themes: War, oriental representation, political chess games, and immigration, all while narrating them with a delightful black comedic tone. One of the best parts of the story is when our narrator is hired by a Hollywood director to act as an advisor for a Vietnam war-themed movie. The obvious representation of natives as mere plot devices by Hollywood movies (Platoon, Apocalypse now, Full metal jacket) was appropriately bashed at this point and it was glorious.\n\u275d After all, nothing was more American than wielding a gun and committing oneself to die for freedom and independence, unless it was wielding that gun to take away someone else\u2019s freedom and independence.\u275e\nI'm chopping one star off because of the last act, which reminded me of Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d's novel, Silence. It was a little too abstract for me, yet true implications of the finale are fascinating. Overall, The Sympathizer's strength lies with its stunningly constructed sentences and its unique perspective that offers something entirely new.

I loved the writing and I loved Viet Thanh Nguyen's perspective on the experiences of Vietnamese refugees in the United States. So I was excited to read The Sympathizer, Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer Prize winning novel. Unfortunately, I didn't love it in the way I loved The Refugees. I'm conflicted as to why:-One of Thanh Nguyen's strengths is his incredible writing -- at times playful, often cutting elegantly to the heart of the matter and always strong and intelligent. For that reason alone, I would read anything he writes.-One of Thanh Nguyen's other strengths is his insight into his characters and their mixed motivations. He is a master at brilliant moments of reflection.-Having said this, at times The Sympathizer felt like too much work, almost like the cleverness got in the way of the story. Thanh Nguyen has created a very complex first person narrator who tells a complex shifting shifty story. The unnamed narrator comes to the United States amongst a group of Vietnamese refugees, but his allegiances still lie ostensibly with the Viet Cong in Vietnam. His story is one of conflicting allegiances and inner conflict. It's a fascinating topic, but somehow the delivery felt almost too clever. The narrative string pivoted relentlessly. It was a bit dizzying and sometimes felt like form was giving over to substance.-There is an underlying sarcasm to the narration. It may reflect self-loathing or the emotional distance the narrator must keep from everyone in order to maintain his role as a \"Sympathizer\". This makes for clever prose, but it does create an emotional distance between reader and narrator. While there is a pretence that the narrator is bearing his soul, is he really? The last two chapters shift the ground a bit, but not enough to change the overall effect for me.-My 3 star rating reflects my personal experience reading The Sympathizer. However, there were definitely many 5 star passages -- for example, instances when the narrator reflected on his childhood or his conflicted role that were truly brilliant.Based on the writing alone, sign me up for Thanh Nguyen's future books. But The Sympathizer is definitely not for everyone.Thank you to GR friends Diane and Angela for reading this one in sync with me. It was my first buddy read.

At other times, when I reflect on how I cannot help but observe the world in such a fashion, I wonder if what I have should even be called talent. After all, a talent is something you use, not something that uses you. The talent you cannot not use, the talent that possesses you \u2013 that is a hazard, I must confess. But in the month when this confession begins, my way of seeing the world still seemed more of a virtue than a danger, which is how some dangers first appear.\"- Viet Thanh Nguyen, The SympathizerI attended a panel last year where Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Shilpi Somaya Gowda were discussing the theme of home in their writing. For immigrants home can be a touchy subject but clearly it can produce great literature.And this one example: only a person who is from the culture, or who has a connection to the culture, could write something like this with such nuance and insight. I find it intriguing how satire and humour is used to tell tough stories and I am impressed by how well Nguyen does that in this book.We all know about the Vietnam war and have probably seen some horrific images from there, but Nguyen uses satire to tell us the story and it works really well in a way I can\u2019t quite put into words right now. I laugh at Nguyen calling 1975 Vietnam a \u201cjackfruit republic that served as a franchise of the United States\u201d, though I can see how awful that reality must have been.Nguyen\u2019s protagonist was interesting too, as a half-French half-Vietnamese communist agent, who was both an insider and an outsider. I appreciated the perspective of someone who doesn\u2019t quite belong anywhere, who, because of his peripheral position in society, gives such insight to both Vietnamese and American culture. It brought to mind the unique perspectives minority writers bring to their writing, the nuances they can pick up that others might not be able to: \u201cAh, the Amerasian, forever caught between worlds and never knowing where he belongs! Imagine if you did not suffer from the confusion you must constantly experience, feeling the constant tug-of-war inside you and over you, between Orient and Occident. \u2018East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet\u2019, as Kipling so accurately diagnosed\u201d.Nguyen picks out racial microaggressions and western hypocrisy without naming them as such, and then proceeds to show us how ridiculous they are. He makes observations that are incisive and hilarious: \"When he interviewed me, he wanted to know whether I spoke any Japanese. I explained that I was born in Gardena. He said, Oh, you nisei, as if knowing that one word means he knows something about me. You\u2019ve forgotten your culture, Ms. Mori, even though you\u2019re only second generation. Your issei parents, they hung on to their culture. Don\u2019t you want to learn Japanese? Don\u2019t you want to visit Nippon? For a long time I felt bad. I wondered why I didn\u2019t want to learn Japanese, why I didn\u2019t already speak Japanese, why I would rather go to Paris or Istanbul or Barcelona rather than Tokyo. But then I thought, Who cares? Did anyone ask John F. Kennedy if he spoke Gaelic and visited Dublin or if he ate potatoes every night or if he collected paintings of leprechauns? So why are we supposed to not forget our culture? Isn\u2019t my culture right here since I was born here? Of course I didn\u2019t ask him those questions. I just smiled and said, You\u2019re so right, sir. She sighed. It\u2019s a job.\" It\u2019s really a fascinating novel that deserves all its accolades.Something I remember from the panel is that Nguyen was discussing censorship in Vietnam and how a publisher in Vietnam wanted to translate the book into Vietnamese. As Nguyen said, \u201cI\u2019d be surprised to learn that I\u2019d published a novella!\u201d His great sense of humour was what led me to read this book and I\u2019m so glad I did."}, {"userName": "linhtalinhtinh", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-linhtalinhtinh", "userReview": "I see the value that this book contributes to American literature. I read New York Times review just a few minutes ago (didn't want anything to interfere with my understanding of the book), and for most part I'd like to agree.Few years I go when I was still in college, I took this class in art history and the famous Vietnam Veteran Memorial came up. Let's not talk about the architecture's significance, but my young mind at that time was just full of surprise: \"What about the South Vietnamese? Where are their names?\"No, they were not recognized, and definitely no memorial for them. Not in Vietnam, sure. Not here in US, either. These soldiers were faceless and voiceless. The closest thing I came across is \"The Other Vietnam Memorial\" by Chris Burden in Chicago, but the names on the bright orange glasses are fake, generated by computer algorithm. Sure, there are millions of North Vietnam casualities, many also nameless and faceless, but not as voiceless. There are memorials everywhere, there are praises in history textbooks, incense sticks lighted on the national veteran day. They have a place in history of the nation.What about these south Vietnamese soldiers? As I write this review I understand more the pain of the refugees. There is this nostalgia of a lost nation, rejected by the new regime in power. There is this effort to assimilate, but we all know Americans are pretty slow in accepting non-whites as full Americans. So they hover in between.The book announces to the world about their existence.But personally I'm not a big fan of the writing, just stylistically. And something's off. It doesn't feel real enough. It's a social criticism, of all sides of the war, which rings true many times. But it's not real for me on the personal level, on the psychological level. The war tragedies for families, for individuals, seem like a movie, sad and brutal, but I'm not connected.

He's extremely articulate, self-effacing and self-deprecating, while extremely observant and analytical, full of humour and truisms. The satire and the absurd make appearances as well.

It's plenty thought-provoking and weighty, uncompromsing in its candor. It has a snarky sense of humor. It provides a underrepresented (to contemporary fiction, anyway) viewpoint of the Vietnamese diaspora here in the United States. Would it, though, have gotten my vote for the Pulitzer? Nope. I can think of several titles more deserving. Even one of the runners-up for the Prize, Kelly Link's bizarre short story collection  Get In Trouble was more deserving, in my opinion. Long-time GR friends will probably be tired of my ongoing grousing about authors that dump quotation marks. A (very) select few authors can get away with it (Colum McCann is one) and that's only because he's been able to shuck quotation marks in such a way that is not confusing or disruptive to the reading experience. Mr. Nguyen, a relative unknown to the literary world prior to his Pulitzer Prize win, does not get an exemption from me. I'm all for creative license, but not when it serves to obfuscate or confuse. Nguyen's choice to dump quotation marks only gave me a headache, trying to parse who said what. One can argue that there isn't much dialogue in this book to warrant my vitriol, but I stand behind it. (Authors: thumbing your nose at convention (by dumping quote marks) is  not creative license. It's an affectation. It addles. It confuses. Give. It. A.

The idea that as reprehensible as the United States' actions were, there were plenty of Vietnamese that were not beyond reproach, either. The hilarity of the unnamed protagonist (once a captain in the Vietnamese army, turned refugee) getting a job as a cultural advisor with an \"auteur\" filmmaker (a very thinly veiled FF Coppola, a very thinly veiled \"Apocalypse Now\"). The nutso idea of a Vietnamese army general with the bright idea of rallying his fellow expatriated boat people who'd fled to the States to foment an insurrectionist movement to topple the communists  whilst in the desert north of Los Angeles.

Still awake and it is four fifteen in the morning. These gales of endless emotions have ripped through these past three hours in my wordless torment and wonder. Devoting myself to whatever feelings swept over me I would not corral them with words. Roped to the mast of a ship I would endure. Waking late this morning there is little difference. Where is time and shouldn\u2019t it being doing its chore to lessen by degree? Time is one essence captured within the glass earthenware jar of this book. The book is pure experience which is why even labeling it as such narrows and empties it. The author, VIET THANH NGUYEN is not one to write but speaks. He speaks as himself, the narrator, in a personal, inviting manner. Despite an occasional analogy, metaphor falling flat (It is a first novel) there are few signs of writing, of literature. He was I and I were he. Not a crease to be found.Saigon is falling. The Americans have left. The South Vietnamese, still consider Vietnam their country. But what is a Country? A negotiated score of boundary marks invisible in landlocked lines or an abstract concept that if manipulated properly will ignite others into patriotism, the willing to sacrifice, to die, to kill others. But Saigon is being over run by the North Vietnamese. As structures both physical and internal crumble it is time to flee. Fleeing isn\u2019t easy. There are only so many planes and long lines. If you have money there is always the opportunity to bribe your way on board, or family members of friends and the powerful find their way.Now in America the politically powerful, the generals strung with medals across their uniforms, are immigrants indistinguishable by the American eye. Though legal they are now invaders who will vie for jobs, will vie for their culture or craftily assimilate themselves into their surroundings. Yet for some it is not that easy. What, to give up one\u2019s identity? If their identity remains their country isn\u2019t it their duty to re-form and re-take it? Doesn\u2019t it become more complicated if you are of the nature, a flexible identity or none at all, where you can see both sides and the possibility of the danger of helping each?Paralysis is by far an interesting thing. My thought was that it\u2019s nature was an instantaneous affair not the slow progress where it travels beneath quiet silken skin and leaves one stunned in a chair, exhausted, at one fifteen in the morning overwhelmed. Not in the abstract either. I should have seen it coming. Looking back it was there. All of it but released in ways that left me rapt not analytical of mind.The Sympathizer is a work of art that does not strive to be a work of art. Far from artless it is an explication of a truth approaching purity. So many of the most important of human questions are delved into without a hint that this unbroken line of seat edge accounting is referring to such.What I lived through, the narrator lived through, is unspeakable yet spoken. These events happened according to the studious and deeply documented sources the author amassed. He acknowledges his minor curating. A curating ever so slight that edges it into a reality of what was taken to be real.I hoped that by writing this my paralysis might recede. Maybe partially but still not detectable. How can I read another book? If I could which? Dante\u2019s Inferno? Something so different as a Borges story? Choosing takes strength, motion. It is always possible that a settling of the house, its foundation, might dislodge a book from my shelves and land in my lap. It could happen\u2026in the abstract.A multitude of thanks goes out to Proustitute for another thoughtful and powerful recommendation."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "13h 53 m narrated by Francois Chau To begin this review I feel the need to share that as I was listening to the audiobook I began to wonder how books qualify for the Pulitzer Prize. So I did a bit of searching online and discovered that \"It( the Pulitzer) recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life, published during the preceding calendar year. \" I then spent sometime perusing the complete list of winners and nominees of this prize since 1917. It appears that my personal journey with books that have eyed or won this prize is a real mixed bag. On one hand, I have books like Gone With the Wind( winner), The Good Earth( winner), To Kill A Mockingbird( winner), Lonesome Dove( winner) and The Snow Child( nominee)that I gloriously loved. On the other, I see books like The Color Purple, The Old Man and the Sea, and All the Light We Cannot See (all winners)were \"okayish\" reads for me.  The Sympathizer is the 2016 winner of the Pulitzer and takes readers on a journey from Saigon to Los Angeles. It took me over a month to get through a 14h audibook and I feel  completly empty of any type of emotion. But how can this be? There is no argument from me that this is a heavy topic. I don't shirk away from that type of book and to have the events of that time period from the point of view of a Vietnamese person rather than a Westerner. So important! The fact that we see the plight of this character as he is forced to flee the land of his birth and try and carve a life for himself in a country struggling to continue with a life post-Vietnam. This book recounts racism in the US and in Hollywood and the type of narrative that needed to be told regarding the war. What an important story to be told, right? Yes, it is! Sadly, I just became further and further ambivalent to what the narrator was experiencing.   Earlier this year, I read \" The Things They Carried\" and I wept over and over again and I have never been a person in a situation where I am facing the draft. But Tim O'Brien was able to connect with me in a way that Viet Thanh Nguyen appeared to fail. But still I find myself asking why? As I glance at my fellow reviewers, I realize that I wasn't swayed by the slow beautiful writing that so many others praise. Instead I felt myself heaving many sighs and muttering \" for the love of my time and patience get to the bloody point.\" So, have I failed to see THE point(s) that the author wanted the North American/Western European audience to grasp? Perhaps! Then I thought that it could be that it was the narration. But I then tried to pick up a hard copy of the book and felt that after one page- I just couldn't see myself trying to sit there and read the book. Maybe it will work for others, but The Sympathizer failed to capture my reading attention and will most likely end up in that list of \"okayish\"reads. But I will leave my review with one interesting item that I discovered as I was learning more about the Pulitzer Prize for literature. Sinclair Lewis actually refused the prize in 1926 stating \"Those terms are that the prize shall be given \"for the American novel published during the year which shall best present the wholesome atmosphere of American life, and the highest standard of American manners and manhood.\" This phrase, if it means anything whatever, would appear to mean that the appraisal of the novels shall be made not according to their actual literary merit but in obedience to whatever code of Good Form may chance to be popular at the moment.\""}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14613561-meghan", "userReview": "Let's read a book about having sex with a dead squid. Because that happens in this book. Somehow I have an ability to pick out books like this. I suppose it's a gift. Just something about me that makes me me.(Squid sex is only like two pages of three hundred and fifty, but I feel it's one of those things that sort of encapsulates what type of book a book is.) The Sympathizer is a long book that could have been about one hundred and fifty pages shorter. It's a book of contradictions, such as the narrator incensed about other people erasing his comrades' proper names, ignoring the fact that he doesn't give proper names to a bunch of people either. It's a book where you keep thinking there's going to be a flashback with an origin story, except that flashback never comes. There's a lot of adjectives and description and over-writing, those stylistic quirks that other people find charming or engrossing, but which I just get annoyed with. And I got annoyed.Repeatedly.There's some stuff that isn't so bad. I appreciate the narrator tells you right away he's a double-agent. None of this sudden-surprise-twist-ending nonsense that has become so popular. He's a double-agent, his one friend Man is a communist, and his other friend Bon, is not. This is where the one hundred and fifty pages of completely transparent criticism of Francis Ford Coppola and Apocalypse Now could be cut (What's the point of that sidetrack? Unnecessary. Lose it.) and replaced with something, even a sentence of why, of three close friends, one-third went to one ideology, while two-thirds went to another. The book isn't free of some twists, although they are obvious so I don't know if one can call them that. I'll say reveals instead I suppose. There's a lot of what I call blah blah blah political discussions, as one might assume would happen at the locale in which they happen in the novel (trying to avoid spoilers I am).I don't know. It took me forever to read this book. I feel bad saying anything negative about it since the author clearly worked hard. So I'll say nothing and laugh because nothing ends up being vital to the story: Nothing is less precious than a bad review.

And then I finally post a review and I\u2019m adorably like \u201clook at me post this three months after I read it lolol\u201d and everyone loves it and we all hug and drink tea or whatever.That\u2019s a usual occurrence.But I have now outdone even myself.I am writing this review a year after I read the book.Yes, you read that correctly. One calendar year after I read this book, I am attempting to share my thoughts on it with you.All that I remember about this at this point is the circumstances in which I read it and the overall feeling it gave me. So let\u2019s talk about those two scintillating things.This is, in its simplest terms, a book about the Vietnam War. Its protagonist and most of its characters are Vietnamese, and portions of it take place in Vietnam.I read the majority of this on the thirty-six hour plane voyage it takes to get to and from Vietnam. So honestly I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve given this book a better chance to be totally goddamn awesome, other than if I had read it while I wasn\u2019t getting up from my window seat every hour on the hour for the dual purpose of having cute, classy panic attacks while sitting on a plane toilet and escaping the guy next to me, who was actively having a mental breakdown and hadn\u2019t stopped talking in three hours.That is actually true. I know I love to exaggerate for the sake of humor, but some of the worst moments of my life took place while I was trapped in a tin can for eighteen hours with only the first five movies of the Fast and Furious franchise to keep me company. (Great film selection on that plane, too.)Anyway.We covered circumstances: let\u2019s talk Overall Emotion.This book made me feel Bad. Mainly uncomfortable. It\u2019s incredibly violent, with moments of really strange humor. Despite being told from the perspective of a spy (what\u2019s the name for a spy who\u2019s pretending to be one side but is really on the other? DOUBLE AGENT. Nailed it) it\u2019s not very thrilling or sneaky or spooky. There\u2019s a lot of talk of alcohol.But overall, I see the Literary Appeal (capital letters very important) of this book. It just wasn\u2019t myyyy kind of literary appeal.I spent a lot more time talking about a plane ride I took once than the actual book in this review. Seems about right.Bottom line: Not for me!!!

Winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction as well as several other awards! Pretty impressive for an author's debut novel. I was the fortunate winner of a goodreads giveaway for this book and I heartily thank Grove Atlantic for their generosity. What is a sympathizer? \"To be in sympathy intellectually; to feel or show support for or approval of something.\"The narrator of the story, who remains nameless throughout the book and is only known to us as 'Captain,' is writing his confession to the Commandant and begins with this statement: \"I am a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces. Perhaps not surprisingly, I am also a man of two minds.\" His story begins in April, 1975, as Saigon is about to fall to the Viet Cong. The captain is a communist mole in the general's employ. As his most trusted assistant, it falls to him to decide who will be included in a last-ditch rescue mission organized by Claude, the American CIA agent. The plane can only hold so many so those he crosses off the list will likely be imprisoned, tortured or killed. Why did the general wait so long to decide to leave the country? With bombs exploding all around them, the scenes at the airport are quite gripping and harrowing! Yet these pages are filled with dark humor.Once they finally make it to America via Guam, the refugees are in for a huge culture shock. People who held important positions in South Vietnam find themselves in menial jobs in their adopted country. The general soothes his bruised ego by trying to raise money to train soldiers and plan a counter-attack that might help regain control of his country from the communist forces. The captain is required to prove his loyalty to the cause in ways that bother his conscience--good Catholic guilt. After all, he was schooled by the French priest who was his father in two ways. His mother was thirteen when she was employed as a maid in service to a French priest and became pregnant by him. The priest never acknowledged him as his son, never called him by name, simply calling him 'you' in class. Even his blood relatives, his Vietnamese aunts and cousins, shun him, calling him a bastard to his face. \"You're a bastard, and like all hybrids you are defective.\" He attends college in America but returns to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause, working as a double agent. Throughout his life, he has felt a duality of identity because of being bi-racial, being both European and Asian, but not really belonging to either race, not accepted for whom he is--\"a bastard who belongs nowhere, not to be trusted by anyone!\" And he proves this to be true, betraying those who believe he is who he pretends to be. And this theme of duality is carried throughout the novel. This is a man who sees both sides and has sympathy for both. He has two childhood friends who are his 'blood brothers,' Bon and Man, one a soldier in the South Vietnamese Army and the other a spy for the communists who 'handles' the captain in his role as spy. And yet, he is somehow able to remain very loyal to both.In America too, he soon learns you are either white or you are not. He observes a duality even in our philosophy of sin and guilt which is expressed in our Christian beliefs and the tenets of our American justice system: \"They believe in a universe of divine justice where the human race is guilty of sin, but they also believe in a secular justice where human beings are presumed innocent.\" How can Americans have it both ways?As an American who lived through the Vietnam war era as a young college student, with many friends who fought in the war, I found the reading experience a bit uncomfortable as the author shines a light on events from a different perspective and dissects why the war was lost--that America fought a war of attrition, not to win, and in the end, abandoned the South Vietnamese people to face their enemy alone. It was not our finest hour. And our 70s culture is skewered too--customs, morals and prejudices. Even the holy icon Hollywood (gasp) is seen in a bad light, through a film that the captain works on as adviser (think Apocalypse Now.)I thought the literary device of telling the story as a confession worked well. I chuckled when his finished confession totalled 307 pages and that was the actual page number we had reached in the book. Nice touch. Viet's debut novel is remarkably well-written and I enjoyed tracing the theme of duality throughout the story, how it played out in the captain's life and his dealings with others. Some small detractions for me that required a half-star deduction: The story seemed a little slow going at first--perhaps the black humor he employs is a bit off-putting and unexpected. A humorous war story? Again, that dichotomy. And a personal pet peeve: I found the lack of quotation marks irritating, making it hard to understand just whom is speaking or if in fact these are occasionally thoughts and not spoken words. Perhaps I'm just old school in that way, but I believe punctuation still has a purpose.

Our narrator (the unnamed 'Captain') is an aide to an important General in the South Vietnamese nationalist army and also an undercover communist agent. The story begins at the end of the conflict, with the Captain engineering a breathless escape to California from a ruined Saigon, along with the General, several army officials and their families. One of his two closest friends, Bon, also travels with him while his other pal Man stays behind. Having studied in LA as a young man, the narrator finds it much easier to settle in the US than most of his comrades. But the duality of his lifestyle comes to haunt him, forcing him down a dark road of murder and betrayal.This book makes some fascinating points about being an outsider in America - how difficult it was for high-ranking Vietnamese soldiers to adjust to new lives as janitors and shop assistants, how strange it was to adapt to a completely alien culture, the prejudices they faced in the country that tried and failed to emancipate them. I found the first hundred pages or so completely gripping, especially the exhilarating getaway from Vietnam and the nefarious acts the narrator is forced to carry out to preserve his identity. However the middle section of the novel dragged for me. I felt that the movie production in which the protagonist is involved (which bears a heavy resemblance to the making of Apocalypse Now) could have been tightened up a lot. In fact I thought several passages of book were quite overwritten and in need of a good editor. But the story does examine some weighty themes like betrayal and revenge in an absorbing, erudite way and for this it deserves praise. It feels like a very \"worthy\" novel and I can see why it won the Pulitzer, but I admired it rather than loved it."}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "I\u2019m not sure about the rest of Canada, but I didn\u2019t learn much about the Vietnam War during my high school history classes. WWI and WWII were taught as highlight reel of major events, cliff notes on battles fought, assassinations of Archdukes, and the social fallout of the wars. Little time was spent in the years that followed, though there was usually a slide on the Cold War. Somewhere on that slide the Vietnam War would find itself a bullet point; part of a list rather than a horrid conflict.This is an unfortunate gap in my education. Though, I can understand why it is not taught in high schools in Canada. It is more complex than WWII. There\u2019s no clean narrative of the villain and the hero\u2019s triumph, as there is with the Axis and Allies. Thus, armed with a complex novel about the Vietnam War, The Sympathizer, and our generation\u2019s most reliable accesible and trustworthy mostly-accurate collection of knowledge, Wikipedia, I decided to get myself edumacated. Now, you don\u2019t need to read my review to decide whether you are going to read this book or not. I hold no illusions that my word will mean more to you than the gold circle that reads \u201cWinner of the Pulizter Prize\u201d emblazoned on the front of my copy of The Sympathizer. Though I like to pride myself on reading a wide variety of literature, the Pulitzers tend to be books that stir up conversation simply by their ubiquity on the shelves of the well read. Personally, I wait earnestly to discover whichever book has won the Fiction Prize each year. I consider the flashy gold circle as good as a guarantee of quality (Olive Kitteridge being an exception, though I appreciated the craft even if I did not enjoy the reading). So, little surprise here, I thought The Sympathizer was great, though there are a few things that keep it from being an absolute knockout of a novel for me. The premise is as follows: the novel is a written confession from a man the reader knows only as the Captain, the circumstances of his writing cloaked in mystery. The Captain is a biracial (French and Vietnamese) sleeper agent in America following the fall of Saigon, reporting back to communist forces in Vietnam. The Captain\u2019s confession, then, serves as the tale of his life as his leaves Vietnam in the back of military aircraft during a bombing, through to the reveal of how he has found himself in his particular predicament.Now, I don\u2019t know about my reading audience, but I expected, with that synopsis, a rather serious tale. Instead, The Sympathizer is actually brimming with humor, doused in satire, and revels in the absurd. The narrator\u2019s tone is equal parts self-deprecating and furious. Indeed, though the novel\u2019s comedic underpinnings could confuse some into thinking it lighthearted, it is anything but. The closing quarter section of the novel was both appalling and enthralling. For readers triggered by stories of torture and the violence of war, consider yourselves warned.What also surprised me (and was discussed in a bonus essay in my edition of the novel) was the angry tone taken throughout the read. The Captain lambasts the Americanized view of the Vietnam War, perhaps most noticeably during the section in which our narrator attempts to establish a Vietnamese perspective for a Hollywood take on the Vietnam War. The book is dripping with anger on behalf of Southern Vietnamese immigrants who found their way to America, as well as the bias view of the war held by the West. It works both as a non-American perspective on the war as well as a novel about the difficulty of life as an immigrant in North America. The novel is a joy to read and took me through a turbulent flight of emotions and reactions. There was laughter, shock, intrigue, horror, disbelief, and passages that I found endlessly profound. Of course, like any rocky flight, there are always those moments when you can\u2019t help but wish your feet were planted on firm ground. There were times when I picked up the book and found it to move slowly, or I was slightly bored by the particularly thread the novel chose to deal with. Luckily, those slow periods don\u2019t last long. Despite being a pretty dense read, the novel keeps a quick pace by regularly switching the direction of the narrative. The escape from Vietnam is quickly followed by a reintroduction of the narrator to America, then he\u2019s off to the film set, then in pursuit of love, etc. The pacing was a bit strange at first, but I admit to being intrigued for never knowing quite what was around the corner for our hero.Unsurprisingly, the writing is outstanding. Viet Thanh Nguyen has a great handle on his character\u2019s divided loyalties, his wry humor, his desires, shames, and brings them all to life through thoughtful prose. There\u2019s some paragraphs that stretch pages and, if I\u2019m allowed a confession of my own, I felt exhausted as I read them. I\u2019ll also admit that while I normally hate when novels bury dialogue into paragraphs that alternate speakers within said paragraphs, it kind of works for The Sympathizer. The confessional conceit of the novel makes the choice to convey dialogue in paragraphs part of the form and function of the story. The Sympathizer is a smart novel that was probably a bit too bold choice for my introduction to Vietnam War writing. With that said, I really enjoyed my experience reading The Sympathizer. I didn\u2019t really touch on the symbolism in the novel, but the duality of the narrator reflects the divided nature of Vietnam, and is further reinforced through other dualities that appear during the Captain\u2019s confession. Fans of books like Midnight\u2019s Children will find a lot to enjoy with Nguyen\u2019s novel. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve ever read a Pulitzer like The Sympathizer, but that\u2019s a good thing."}, {"userName": "Tim Park", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64719231-tim-park", "userReview": "...this was a challenging and demanding novel for me... i had to refer to the dictionary seemingly every few pages to look up words, and the lack of quotation marks and proper paragraph use added to the difficulty... but there was a reason for that i guess, which becomes apparent as you read... the story itself was fascinsting, but for me slow to start... i had to reread the first 30 pages or so... it really started to hook me around page 50 and for most of the book thereafter i was deeply engaged...
