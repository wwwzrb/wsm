During that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again. Life after Life tells the story of Ursula\u2019s lives, as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path.I feel like I\u2019m the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated. Sure Kate Atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn\u2019t the writing that was at fault. The premise of the book makes it sound really good but let\u2019s face it; it is just Groundhog Day in disguise. The book is clever, but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn\u2019t really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway. This book is getting so many rave reviews, I feel like I am a black sheep just telling people it did not work.As I said before, there is nothing wrong with the writing; Kate Atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and I did find myself being swept away in the words. I even felt like at times I was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times I had to stop and process before continuing. I almost found myself not noticing a death and Ursula\u2019s life starting again and that could have got me completely lost. I did feel like Kate Atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes. This could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but I sadly wasn\u2019t one of them.I wonder if Kate Atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character\u2019s death and life, explore the concept of life\u2019s choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to Ursula\u2019s life I wonder if it really worked? Do you ever have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? (I don\u2019t think so, but I could check with the kitchen) Life after Life just seems to repeat the same scenes, some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.Life after Life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy, dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it. Maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don\u2019t forget your booties \u2019cause it\u2019s cooooold out there today (It\u2019s coooold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?). It is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in Townsville, maybe that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work for me.I really wanted to enjoy this book; I will try another Kate Atkinson novel because I really think she has a great style. Just so happened Life after Life was not for me and I know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some Groundhog Day quotes into something. This book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me, if the book sounds like something you\u2019d like then don\u2019t let this review stop you, is it too early for flapjacks?This review originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev..."}, {"userName": "Banafsheh Serov", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1897066-banafsheh-serov", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book. I wish I could enjoy it. I bought it with such enthusiasm, and couldn't wait to start reading it. But alas, I sensed almost at the very start that it wasn't going to be a happy relationship - a point confirmed by mid-way through the book.The length, the repetitive scenes, the incredible number of times Ursula dies and is reborn, are all tedious and terrible torment to get through. 2/3rds in, I found myself offended for having my time wasted. Surely Atkinson could show the courtesy of not subjecting her readers to so many repetitive scenarios. I cannot fault Atkinson's writing nor do I have any particular dislike for her characters (I rather liked Izzy the best). But the plot lost my interest fairly early on and by the end, I positively wanted to hurl it at a wall (I didn't. I'm rather fond of my walls). My apologies for offending anyone with this review. I understand our tastes are subjective and many simply adore this book.

(excluding what i am considering to be a prologue) and then again. and again. she will die from falling off a roof, from drowning, from gas-inhalation, but she will be reborn again to live a collage of different lives, but always as ursula, and always surrounded by the same family. sometimes she can remember her past go-rounds, in hazy half-memories, and sometimes she can remember more, but this is not some hippy-dippy exploration of spiritual reincarnation. i have never read a book that is more human, more terrestrial. it is not necessarily about \"getting it right\" although you cheer inside every time she manages to avoid the decisions that led to some of her more horrifying deaths. it is more about our possible paths, about family, about history.it is about ripples and traps and the horrors of war.and, oh, war. i have read many books about england during wartime, whether it be I or II. but never have i read one with more immediacy than this one. she does such a fantastic job with this particular material. not just the parts that you would think i would respond to, being of a ghoulish bent. the \"recovery of the bodies\" scenes were very graphic and haunting and shivery, yes, but i found myself responding not to the shocking descriptions, but more to the quieter scenes, the ones which are focused on the national character during wartime. the englishness of this novel is just brilliant. there is such a pervading sense of \"one does as one must and then one has tea\" throughout. On the way back from lunch, Sylvie said she wanted to visit Oberpollingers and buy a present for Hugh. When they reached the department store they found the windows daubed with anti-Jewish slogans and Sylvie said, \"Gracious, what a mess.\" The shop was open for business but a pair of grinning louts in SA uniform were loitering in front of the doors, putting people off from entering. Not Sylvie, who had marched past the Brownshirts while Ursula reluctantly trailed in her wake into the store and up the thickly carpeted staircase. In the face of the uniforms, Ursula had shrugged a cartoon helplessness and murmured rather shamefacedly, \"She's English.\" She thought that Sylvie didn't understand what it was like living in Germany but in retrospect she thought that perhaps Sylvie had understood very well.i love that passage, on at least three different levels. the brisk insouciance of a mother accustomed to living in an imperial nation, the shame of a transplanted daughter living in a changing country whose climate she is becoming a part of, but doesn't yet fully understand, and the latent judgment passing as ignorance. and this, which perfectly sums up the english spirit:\t\"No point in thinking,\" she said briskly, \"you just have to get on with life. We only have one after all, we should try and do our best. We can never get it right, but we must try.\"i loved that about this book. it is practical, unhysterical perfection. there is a determination to these characters in the face of horrors and lives lived always on the brink of destruction that is admirable and almost uplifting. you know, if it weren't for all the bombs.this book killed me, it really did. and then i was reborn, as a reader. it is such a labor of love; you can feel how much thought atkinson put into it, with all of its carefully-sprinkled echoes from former life-plots, and how lovingly-rendered are even the smallest supporting characters (mr. emslie!! \u2665). obviously, i love izzie, the free-spirited drunken floozie of an aunt, even though she is such a selfish character. but that's kind of what this book is about - how when we are living our lives, we miss a great deal of what is happening around us, and if we had a chance to step back, to see the bigger picture, we might make different decisions, and in some cases, we could change the course of history.which sounds trite, but kate atkinson is a much more accomplished writer than i am, and this book is an absolute triumph.you will have to wait until april to read this, unless you are greg, and are getting it friday, and then it will be mailed off to canada to bill. and it is a beautiful-looking arc:\n\nso i am sad to see it go, but one does as one must."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "DECEMBER 2013Paul Bryant had really only just started driving back home, was still trying with his left hand to jam the seat belt buckle into its lock, and \u2013 multitasking like mad - he was thinking about how to review Life After Life, and probably getting too caught up in the various amusing ways it could be done, so that he simply didn\u2019t notice the car poking far too far out of the side street.

Stupid boy racer! He thought as he made a violent emergency stop. When he did finally get home he parked as usual round the corner, got out of his car and was delighted to be confronted with one of the urban foxes which visited Sherwood occasionally. Such elegant raffish creatures. But there seemed to be something agitating this particular one. It was moving side to side and then turning right round in some distress. What was wrong with it? Suddenly it lunged towards him, nipped him on the ankle and rushed away. He thought about the disturbing incident later that evening as he sat at his computer and began his review. But then he began to feel most peculiar. He suddenly hated all the people who had written sniffy reviews of Life After Life comparing it to Groundhog Day (as if \u2013 that may be a totally great movie but Bill Murray is aware of reliving his endless day, and Ursula is not aware of reliving her life, and it\u2019s her whole life \u2013 it\u2019s not even Groundhog Life, please, don't get me started); but also his mouth was dripping saliva, he had a high temperature, he was sweating like crazy, and his hair was standing straight up.

But this one looked a little strange. Thinking it might possibly be rabid, he gave it a blare on the car horn and it ran off. Later that evening, sat at his computer, he was trying to marshal his thoughts on Kate Atkinson\u2019s pitch-perfect contemplation of our little lives and their infinite forking paths (Ursula\u2019s main problem was that she couldn\u2019t change the fact that she was born in 1910 \u2013 Hitler was always waiting for her) and how this gimmicky pop-philosophical soft-science fiction not-quite-alt-hist novel morphs into a terrifying war story, one of the best descriptions of life during the Blitz ever \u2013 but his thoughts were interrupted by the roar of a police helicopter. They fly around Sherwood sometimes, always en route to St Ann\u2019s, which is gangster territory. This one seemed to be right above his house. What a racket. Suddenly, the noise stopped. Peace!

The plot, however, left me floundering for weeks, trying desperately to claw my way to the end of this depressing tale. While the premise - reincarnation and destiny - is interesting, the execution left me frustrated.The early chapters of the book are very short, as Ursula is born, dies, and is reborn again with rapid succession. With each successive life, she lives longer (in most cases) and is developed more and more as a character. The choppy format of the early chapters make it difficult to get attached to Ursula, but as she lives longer, it becomes more and more apparent that she lives a sad, depressing life. In addition, as a result of her continued rebirth, it's difficult to become attached to her, or to feel any real regret or sadness at her passing. Also strange is that, as often as you meet them throughout Ursula's life, her siblings never really become fully realized characters. As they move in and out of her life, these siblings play important roles in the paths she follows, yet they remain rather one-dimensional, as though Atkinson couldn't be bothered to spend the time on them.The book was also a bit too meandering in its plot. Lives that led no where interesting or important wandered on for far too long, while lives that seemed to be leading somewhere ended abruptly, only to pick up again to follow another pointless path. Perhaps this was Atkinson's exploration of the capricious nature of fate, but it made for some rough reading. About 100 pages of this novel could have been trimmed and it would only have improved the quality. Forty of those hundred pages should have been the last forty of the book - the last few \"lives\" lived by Ursula were confusing and unnecessary to the novel.All in all, the writing was exactly what you'd expect from Atkinson (wonderful), but the story itself was confusing, lifeless, and somewhat empty. A hundred fewer pages, a different ending, and more fully fleshed-out secondary characters would have resulted in a 4 star book for me.(I received a review copy from the publisher in exchange for a review.)"}, {"userName": "John Herbert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8523656-john-herbert", "userReview": "Oh dear dear dear dear dear!Obviously I'm on another planet to all the other reviewers here, but try as I might, I simply had to give up on page 265...and call it a day.The concept of constant re-births and lives was a good one but sadly, for me,the incidents throughout were so tame and tepid, and the characters that popped into Ursula's lives were so boring, I'm afraid the whole thing was like watching paint dry.Remember that feeling of rushing to get back to a book to read what happens next? This was the exact opposite - dreaded picking it up, and trying to dredge up some interest in this conglomeration of non-entities!Having paid \u00a315.99 for this attractive looking hardback, I felt that I had to do the payment justice and at least give it a good try....but just over half way.....enough was enough!!!If you want to really read a book that does this multi-life premise true justice, then read KEN GRIMWOOD'S book entitled REPLAY.Now you're talking."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "I'm pretty sure the idea of being forced to live my life over and over again is something plucked from my worst nightmares, but who among us hasn't been at least tempted to dream of it occasionally with a wistful sigh. Please, please, please, just one more chance to live the best moments again and when necessary, to make different choices? But I would imagine if any of us were actually tasked to unravel all the \"right\" and \"wrong\" choices from our life and to relive the bad with the good, we'd go screaming into the night like raving banshees.For what is a perfect life? How many kicks at the can would it take for you to answer that question, if it is indeed answerable at all? Change one thing, change everything, change nothing, change all the good, change all the bad. Round and round and round. It's exhausting just thinking about it. What's the saying? If I only knew then, what I know now...what? What would you do different? And would different choices always translate into better choices? Ursula is a normal British girl except she's pretty certain she's lived her life before, maybe many, many times. The older she gets, the stronger these feelings of deju vu become, hounding her like ghosts in the night. Her prescience is rarely crystal clear, more like moods or instinct. Do this. Don't do that. Run away. Run toward. Stay still.Life After Life starts slow and unassuming. The story is teasing, the pacing a dawdling, scenic walk through the English countryside. But from the very first page I was enthralled and little did I realize what a powerful spell Atkinson was casting on my reader brain. Because as you continue to read, the book picks up gravity and speed and texture. Each life after life reinforces the tender bonds you have been working on with each of the characters. Your acquaintance with them is not one brief life, but many, many lives. Like Ursula we are both cursed and blessed with the long view, the big picture. We come to know all the various permutations of death, cruelty, love and loss. We bear witness through two World Wars and how some forces, no matter how forewarned, are unstoppable, greater even than the hand of time.This is a very English story, and is steeped in pre-1950 historical detail. Not ever having watched an episode of Downton Abbey I'll go out on a limb here and suggest fans of that show will love this novel for its acute sense of time and attention to detail. Atkinson is ruthless in her pursuit for authenticity. This is wartime England, no time to pussyfoot around. This has got to be right, and in her quest I believe she succeeds magnificently. The details are small but glorious, and paint such an intimate portrait you will feel absorbed into Ursula's quiet family life where there are disagreements and births, and jealousies and forgiveness. Yes, there is the rumble of the earth as the German bombs fall during the Blitz, but such terrible moments co-exist with the stark ordinariness of a life lived. Dinners, and picnics, and birthdays and games of cricket, and work, and gardening, and lots and lots of tea. \"Ow!\" one of the evacuees squealed beneath the table. \"Some bugger just kicked me.\"...Something cold and wet nosed itself up Ursula's skirt. She hoped very much that it was the nose of one of the dogs and not one of the evacuees.This knowledge of the ATS girl's background seemed to particularly infuriate Edwina, who was gripping the butter knife in her hand as if she were planning to attack someone with it--Maurice or the ATS girl, or anyone within stabbing distance by the look of it. Ursula wondered how much harm a butter knife could do. Enough she supposed. There is whimsy and humor laced throughout this novel and it makes for a beautiful contrast to the more serious components of tragedy and war. Life is a farce after all; if you can't find the humor in it you've been doing it wrong or have missed the point entirely. Atkinson has not missed the point. As readers, we are in capable hands. She has one helluva story to tell you, and trust me, you don't want to miss it.

No way. It just would not have happened. And this wonderful fiction writer didn't make me believe that it happened within the pages of her book. I wonder if Atkinson struggled with this part and whether she believed it herself. These sections lost me; they felt lifeless. This section reminded me of Woody Allen in his movie Zelig, suddenly and surprisingly showing up in various historical moments. That worked. This didn't.

It\u2019s just not really obvious in the end whether the choice that she eventually makes to study German & get close enough to kill Hitler before his rise to power is what she\u2019s meant to do.

Since this is the book in my hands, I have to assume that yes, her whole existence is predicated on shooting Hitler in a coffee shop in 1930, but that isn\u2019t what I get from the ending. In 1930 she kills Hitler. In 1945 her brother is found alive after the war. Then it\u2019s 1910 again & the midwife who never made it to Ursula\u2019s birth is still drinking rum in a snug.

I'm a huge Kate Atkinson fan and I think she's one of the most creative writers I've ever read. And I loved the idea of this book: Ursula is born, dies, and is born again, living different -sometimes very different - versions of her life over and over again. One of my problems is that there didn't seem to be any \"rules\" like there usually are in books about time travel and other magical occurrences. Sometime Ursula seems to remember the past versions of her life, sometimes she seems not to. Sometimes things change drastically, sometimes not so much. I found that confusing and sometimes hard to follow. And the unfortunately at the end I lost track of which life she was in and totally didn't understand what happened!

It was February of 1910 when baby Ursula died at birth, but she was granted a narrative do-over. Next time the doctor made it through the snowstorm to sever the umbilical cord that was strangling her. She also got another chance after tumbling from the roof trying to reach a doll her malignant older brother had thrown there. Similar life after death sequences played out after a seaside drowning, the Spanish flu, and various war-time atrocities. Some might call this a gimmick, but that seems too pejorative a term to me. In Atkinson\u2019s capable hands it was a wonderful tool that allowed her to play \"what if\", to explore subtle changes with far-reaching consequences (though butterflies and chaos were never mentioned), as well as to evaluate moral trade-offs where alternative scenarios improve the lot of some to the detriment of others. The way I\u2019ve described this so far you might imagine that Punxsutawney Phil and a very resigned Bill Murray would feature at every turn. But it wasn\u2019t really like that. For one thing, the story didn\u2019t always revert back to square one (where the Sonny and Cher equivalent might have been playing on the gramophone). Plus, there were exogenous differences in each scenario, separate from Ursula\u2019s actions. A better analogy might be how we navigate our way through a maze, proceeding until we reach a dead end and backtracking to the point where we can follow a different path. But even that\u2019s not quite right. With the maze, we know where the decision points are. At best, Ursula had dim recollections of previous paths taken \u2013 a vague sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Atkinson scored literary points for the artful abstractions of these foggy memories. Before I get too carried away with the device, which I suspect had to do with a huge inventory of ready-to-use death scenes Atkinson wanted to employ ;-) , I should mention what I consider to be even better selling points: the story, the characters and the setting. As fans of her Jackson Brodie books will attest, Atkinson is a master of crime drama. She was not about to short-shrift us on plot. Each snippet of Ursula\u2019s life (or, more appropriately, lives) had plenty going on including creative avoidance of paths we knew from before wouldn\u2019t work. Her relationships with men got appreciably better in later iterations once she got past her teenage naivety and some very unwelcome advances. Many of the most poignant storylines derived from the hardship of the setting \u2013 England spanning the two world wars. You might imagine that air raids, deprivation, and loss of loved ones would leave little time for character development beyond a collective stiffness of upper lips, but you\u2019d be wrong. Ursula herself was insightful, empathetic, philosophical and poetic. Her family members, including a larger-than-life aunt who struck it big with a children\u2019s book series, had memorable traits as well; all of them recognizably human. Friends and co-workers were given enough personality to be interesting, too. That was even true of the German ones.Speaking of Germans, there was one in particular that authors of do-overs consistently wish dead. Atkinson was no exception (which I don\u2019t consider a spoiler since it was taken up in the first two pages). It is a fascinating question, even if over-asked. What if he had been killed before he had influence? How many lives would have been spared? What would our culture be like had there been no Holocaust? Or, as Ursula wondered, what if the US had not spent its way out of the Depression during the war and become the dominant purveyor of goods and lifestyles. (Cheeky lady, implying it would be better. But I have to ask: how fast would her food be now? And how much reality would her TV feature?)I really liked this book. Typically I\u2019m suspicious of devices that quantum physics, even at its strangest, can\u2019t explain. But this one felt right. In a time when life was too easily lost, in a place where the war seeped into too many homes, it seemed appropriate that a work of fiction would offer some therapeutic revamping. All the more so after Atkinson personalized it for us, putting a likable lady with multifold potential in the middle of it all. And if one of the goals of personal development is to choose optimal paths, it\u2019s helpful to see a template where repeated trials over similar circumstances lead to better decisions and an older soul."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason", "userReview": "I\u2019m rating this book two stars only on a technicality\u2026which is that technically speaking, this book sucks.Ursula Todd is an English-born nobody. Born into a large wealthy family, there isn\u2019t a whole lot about her that stands out. She shares a closeness with one or two of her siblings, but overall she has a pretty meek personality and remains largely invisible most of her life\u2014with the caveat that \u201cmost of her life\u201d in Ursula\u2019s case actually means \u201cmost of her lives\u201d because this bitch keeps on dropping dead and coming back again.Life After Life is a book that focuses on Ursula\u2019s slow build-up, over the course of multiple lives (because it takes her hundreds of tries to get it right), to assassinating Adolf Hitler. This is not a spoiler, by the way. The assassination occurs on page one. The hundreds of lives it takes for her to get to that point occur on pages two through five hundred twenty-nine. And that includes the following exits, stage left (spoiler alert if you\u2019re a Final Destination fan): umbilical cord strangulation, asphyxiation by natural gas, blunt force trauma by a falling brick wall, blunt force trauma by a homicidal husband, suicide by cyanide capsule, stroke (or whatever the hell that was on the park bench), falling off a roof, Spanish flu, drowning, Blitz bombing. Some of these happen repeatedly because it takes Ursula several lives to figure out that she\u2019s doing something wrong and needs to adjust her strategy. She can\u2019t exactly remember her previous deaths, but she does know something is amiss and can occasionally execute a modification to her preordained path and avoid that outcome...only to have a different mortal outcome occur in its stead, of course. (But truthfully, most of the time the modification occurs on its own without her having to do anything at all. Magic!)And that is what is most bothersome to me, I think (besides her dull personality). It is exhausting to read about a woman dying over and over again only to be reborn right back where she started, and all without seeming to have any input into anything whatsoever. She just goes along with the program, a plastic bag beaten about by the wind. All the dumb things she has done along the way, all the idiots she enters into relationships with, it all starts over, and then you start to get confused as to who\u2019s alive and who\u2019s dead in this new life of hers and is she still with this person? Is she a mother this time around? A spinster? And then you start to realize that who cares. It doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019ll just die again anyway. In fact the only time she ever starts to make real decisions is toward the end of the novel after she has lived a ludicrous number of lives, and are we supposed to be at this point rooting for her? What most of us have just one lifetime to figure out she gets hundreds, and even so it\u2019s still not enough? One of my favorite of Ursula\u2019s decisions is that after dying a bunch of times in the Blitz, she decides to spend her next life somewhere safer and moves from London to fucking Munich.Good grief.Also, the character interactions, which is something I usually enjoy in novels, is pretty nonexistent here. Characters don\u2019t have meaningful interactions in Life After Life; they merely quip and provide one-liners before the narrative moves onto the next scene (which is often just as dull). Reading this book ultimately became tiresome to me, which is not really how you want your reading experience to go.Looking at the ratings for this novel it\u2019s clear I\u2019m in the minority, which is why I felt a certain pressure to isolate the components of it that irritated me or caused me to dislike it, but the truth is I don\u2019t really know for sure if it was any of these things in particular or if it was the whole package to blame, but the bottom line is that this book was just not for me."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "\u201cWhat if we had a chance to do it again and again, until we finally did get it right? Wouldn't that be wonderful?\u201d\nLife After Life is a novel I probably wouldn't have chosen for myself. And how sad it is to think that I might have passed this novel over and never known these characters and relationships. It often seems like I am the only person in the world who hasn't watched Downton Abbey (definitely the only Brit who hasn't) but the favourable comparisons I keep seeing between the show and this book make me want to drop everything and go watch it. I imagine it has similarities. All the drama of wartime England combined with a soft, often quiet story about family life and just... people. So many people come and go in this novel, but each one is lovingly-crafted and leaves their own personal mark. I adore it when authors do this - and so few do - when they make sure every single character becomes a human being with a life and personality beyond pushing the plot in a certain direction.The story centres around Ursula Todd who is born one snowy night in 1910 and dies that night from strangling on her own umbilical cord. On that same night in 1910, Ursula is born and lives. What follows is a strange life full of many deaths that were, at the same time, also avoided. Somehow, in the hands of this extremely talented writer, a concept as trite as second chances becomes original, beautiful and so so moving.I would not sell this as a fast-paced adventure; it's pacing is relatively slow and it takes a while for the reader to realise that this book has far more depth than they first imagined. It bobs along at a steady pace, full of dazzling wit, humour and charm. It has an unmistakable old-fashioned Englishness about it - all tea time and \"goodness gracious\" - which works very well with the time and setting. But still, it was far from boring. It is too charming and well-written to be boring, and I could hardly put it down once I became absorbed in the characters' stories (which didn't take long at all).This novel seems to gather layers as it goes. One minute you're sipping tea and enjoying the relationship dynamics, and the next you suddenly look back and realise that this quiet little wartime story has become steeped in philosophical detail, without seeming pretentious or too try-hard. Such a wonderful read and highly recommended.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "What I expected to be Borgesian, absolutely meta, actually turned out a tad gimmicky and, no joke, choose-your-own-adventure-like.

It symbolizes the cyclic nature of the universe, creation out of destruction, life after death. Likewise, the famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, advanced the concept of the Shadow self, the parts of your self that are hidden from society. The process of becoming whole, psychically, is to integrate the unconscious (Shadow) and conscious selves, through deep meditation, dreams, or long journeys that build awareness.If this seems too much of an academic introduction to the brilliantly epochal novel by Kate Atkinson, it is also a reference to the finely calibrated structure and themes of life...after life. Atkinson time travels her narrative back to Feb 11, 1910, repeatedly, so that her protagonist, Ursula Todd, can return again and again to rebirth and renewal. Right from the beginning, Ursula dies quickly after birth. Then she returns. Dies rather quickly again. In subsequent lives, she may take longer to die. But through each of these lives, we learn a lot more about Ursula. And, so does Ursula learn more about herself. For example, after a tragedy in one life, Ursula tends to feel a sense of something, or a chill, when the tragedy is coming close in the next life, and can often do something to prevent its reocurrence, even though she is not quite sure why she is doing it.Atkinson did it with such holographic clarity that I wondered how it had not been done a thousand times before in literature. If I searched for similarly structured movies, however, GROUNDHOG DAY and BUTTERFLY EFFECT would come to mind as cousins, perhaps.There is certainly a purpose to this structure, but it isn't mechanical or expeditious. You may be scratching your head, wondering as you read, but you will settle in before long. The novel is so dynamic, and initially winsome (and subtly tongue-in-cheek), that you feel in the bosom of it, not at arm's length or outside the story. Is it a gimmick? No, it is the anchor. It doesn't seem segmented or choppy; rather, it all integrates, like Jung's concept.Ursula's darkness penetrates to a metaphysical undertaking, and the reader is side by side with her odyssey. The author captures Ursula's moments of life-to-death-to-life enchantingly, yet poignantly, and the cycles nourish the theme of the story. Those in-between moments of life and death pique reader understanding, too. Her frequent returns don't feel repetitive, because Atkinson brings acuity and new observations for the reader to ponder.\"...she could feel the shining, luminous world beyond calling, the place where all mysteries would be revealed. The darkness enveloped her, a velvet friend. Snow was in the air, as fine as talcum, as icy as the east wind on a baby's skin...\"The author also weaves in penetrating allusions to the unconscious mind within the chaos, destruction and detritus of war. The settings(s) of the novel preside like a primary character, one in which repeated experience manifests deeper understanding. Like Ursula, I am inclined to return, time and again, and let the pages encircle me into the \"black bat of darkness\" and the snow blazing white of day.\"Time isn't circular.

What it was like to live with the threat of being bombed every single night, horrifying.

Kill off your heroine, early and often, while offering a look at the history of England from 1910 to the 1960s. I would love to tell you more but an SUV appears to have run a red light at the corner, had a too close encounter with a very large truck and seems to be heading into this caf\u00e9...Gotta go. Damn! Now, where were we, a review? Yes, I seem to recall something about that. More of a feeling really. So, England, 20th century, perils of Pauline, well in this case Ursula, little bear, of Fox Corner, the manse of a well-to-do sort, not Downton rich, but, you know, comfortable. She has a prat of an older brother and a decent elder sis, with a couple of brothers arriving later. Kate Atkinson - from The TelegraphLife is full of decision points. Walk this way, survive, walk that way and splat. It begins early with Ursula, who is offed before her first breath the first time around. She gets a better deal on the next go, managing to remain with us into childhood, and so on. The structure seems to employ the backstitch a fair bit, starting Ursula up a few chronological paces before the deadly decision point. She seems to be born again more than an entire congregation of fundamentalist Christians, or, maybe more likely a band of Buddhists, as she seems to pick up a bit of wisdom, a bit of strength with each reincarnation. I counted 15 passings-on, but sure, I could have missed one or two. The lady must have G. Reaper on her autodial. What if I had done this instead of that? How might that have changed the outcomes? One can imagine the fun, and challenge an author experiences. Taking her main character, and plenty of secondary characters as well, in one direction then another, then another. It must mimic, to a degree, the authorial process. What if I do this to Ursula? What might happen? What if I point her in a different direction? And as for stuff happening, while it is usually pretty calm here, writing while on a bench in Prospect Park, I must admit I have never seen tentacles that size emerging from anywhere let alone the very modest Park Lake. The slurping sounds are getting rather loud. That sumbitch is faster than he looks\u2026Gotta go. Damn!So, I felt like sitting with some coffee but the local caf\u00e9 just seemed, I don\u2019t know, not what I wanted. Then I considered maybe heading over to the park to work on a review, but it looks like it might rain, so I think I\u2019ll stick at home for now. Of course the desktop has been a bit dodgy of late, but no big whup. I will dip into the special Kona stash, brew up a nice cuppa and set to, shoes off, no shirt. Maybe a nice bagel with butter and strawberry preserves. Yummm! Review, yes, Atkinson, Ursula, do-overs. Oh yeah, it does call to mind a bit of Groundhog Day, although Phil the Weatherman knew early on that he was coming back each time. Not Ursula, although as time goes on she does develop a bit of a sixth sense about some things. And the other major difference here is that Life After Life takes on some heftier purpose than Phil getting the girl and becoming a better person. Ursula is faced with some immediate challenges, like evading a rapist, a girl-killer, those annoying Nazi bombs during the blitz, not falling out windows, you know, stuff. But she also must contend with moral choices, and larger scale. Not only figuring out what the right thing is to do and then deciding, for her life, but thinking about how events affect other people, the nation, maybe the world. What sort of life does she want to lead? How can she help the most people? What sort of person does she want to be? Can she make an impact beyond her immediate concerns? And within that context, others face similar choices. Ursula is not the only one with multiple exit scenes. There are plenty in the chorus of secondary characters who come and go, or should that be go and come back in varying iterations. What if so-and-so did A this time and B the next? How might that change things? This is part of the fun of the book. Not all the decisions are of the life-threatening variety, but they can seriously impact one\u2019s life, other lives as well.

I hadn\u2019t realized how much I would get entangled in 1910-1939 as opposed to 1939-1945. - from Chatelaine interviewThere have certainly been some wonderful novels in the last few years that play with structure. A Visit from the Goon Squad is one of the more dramatic of that sort. The rise of the novel comprised of linked stories has seen a boom in popularity. This year\u2019s Welcome to Braggsville takes some chances with form as well. And so it is with Life After Life. While the notion of reincarnation is hardly new in fiction, how it is handled here is far beyond what we have seen before, a real risk-taking. And so effective.Ursula is a very engaging character. Each time she comes back, you want her to stick around. And even when she makes bad choices you will be rooting for her to fix those in the next round. Her sister Pamela seems as decent a sort as their brother Maurice seems insufferable, maybe a bit too insufferable. We get to see dimensions to Atkinson\u2019s characters over the many iterations, learn something new about them, sometimes surprisingly so. I found it to be entirely engaging, and was always sad when Ursula went dark yet again. The book opens with her taking aim at the worst baddie of the 20th century and you will keep hoping she finds her way back to that place and completes the mission. Will she?One of the most riveting and memorable elements in Life After Life is the description of London during the Blitz, on the ground, you-are-there, offering considerable nightmare material, and making it clear just how hardy the survivors must have been, and how fragile the hold on life, whichever iteration a person is in. The best part of the book, for me. There are many uses of animal references here. Ursula means little bear, The family name, Todd, means Fox. A group of Nazi wives is referred to as a wolf pack. Actual foxes move in and out of the story, residents of Fox Corner, the Todd family home. A German is named Fuchs which also means fox. There are more. A warden during the Blitz is named Woolf. At one point, Atkinson offers a wink and a nod to readers as her characters discuss time travel questions. There is much consideration here of the role and rights of women in the first half of the 20th century, and the changes in mores that marked the era. The difference between love and gratitude when considering marriage is considered. The effect of World War I on the nation is noted as well, the loss of a generation of men in the war, and the loss of vast numbers from both genders from the Spanish flu. While florid passages do not characterize the novel, there are some wonderful descriptions. One of my favorites regards the night sky during the Blitz\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a painting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Miss Woolf said.\u201cOf the Apocalypse maybe,\u201d Ursula said. Against the backdrop of black night the fires that had been started burned in a huge variety of colors\u2014scarlet and gold and orange, indigo and a sickly lemon. Occasionally vivid greens and blues would shoot up where something chemical had caught fire. Orange flames and thick black smoke roiled out of a warehouse\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s spectacular, isn\u2019t it? Savage and strangely magnificent.\nYes it is.Now that the task is done, I think I will bring in a glass of juice and have some of these lovely hard sourdough pretzels. Maybe catch something from the DVR. Always loved these pretzels, except, of course, when bits get stuck going down. Sometimes large bits, uh oh, a very large bit\u2026trying to self-Heimlich, but no go, hitting my head on the edge of the coffee table as I stumble and fall while trying to stand up.

(?)I struggled to find a word which would describe my reaction to Life After Life - Kate Atkinson's latest novel, released to considerable hype - and I came up with this. It's no perfect but then my reaction is not perfectly uniform as well; one can't accuse ms. Atkinson of being a hack and phoning her book in, not having an interesting enough idea or even of being a poor writer. She writes well, her concept is interesting and her writing flows easily and doesn't obstruct the storyline(which is not always a bad thing). So why am I unimpressed?Life After Life begins with an unusual situation. Ursula Todd, the protagonist, dies at the day of her birth in 1910 - an infant strangled with the umbilical cord during the delivery. In the very next scene Ursula's birth is shown to be happening again, but this time a doctor arrives to save the baby from asphyxiation. Ursula is born and lives, but soon dies again in different circumstances, only to be born and live once more, in yet another alternative version of the same event. And so it goes - rinse and repeat, life after life.The theme of reincarnation in fiction is neither new or unpopular - witness the success of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, which was adapted into a blockbuster film last year. While I thought that Cloud Atlas was a bit gimmicky and didn't really breach any new grounds, it definitely had its advantages - such as David Mitchell's literary ventriloquism displayed by creation of several stories entirely different in tone and genre, but united by a common theme. Life After Life focuses on exploring different outcomes of certain situations - but this makes it feel repetitive and dull after a while: once Ursula dies for the umpteenth time we know for sure that a different version of the events leading to her death would kick. We realize that there isn't really a definite version of Ursula's story; it became increasingly difficult for me to care about any of them as I found myself being less and less interested.Life After Life contains several gripping and emotional scenes set during the London Blitz, two that stick in memory are of Ursula being trapped under the rubble and suffering from bitter cold and lack of resources. But even they lose their impact in the repetitiveness of the novel. As I read on, I found myself thinking that the reading experience resembles trying to jumpstart an old car which died in the middle of the road; we push and try to start the engine which spurts on for a moment, and we can ride in it for a few minutes, until it dies once more, forcing us to get out and start pushing once again. Even if the old car will carry us all the way to the destination, we find ourselves wishing we'd rather walked or took the bus instead. And os it was for me with Life After Life - after a while I had to push myself to read on, and even though it started up for a while it soon died again, forcing me to redouble my efforts. In the end, I felt that even thought I made it all the way to the end my undertaking was not appropriately rewarded.I'll certainly read more of Kate Atkinson's work, since she's a readable and entertaining writer - it's just this book that didn't do it for me. Any recommendations? Behind the Scenes at the Museum looks interesting, as do Case Histories."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam", "userReview": "\u201cNo point in thinking, you just have to get on with life. We only have one after all, we should try and do our best. We can never get it right, but we must try.\u201d\n While I can understand the mixed reaction, and wouldn't call it a book for everyone, Life After Life is a beautifully written, acutely English, slow-burner of a novel, a beautiful piece of family drama and comedy, and a fantastic work of historical fiction. It's wrapped in a high-concept conceit of our protagonist Ursula's continual birth and rebirth into her not quite the same life, but said conceit is executed softly, subtly, played for laughs, used to display the horrors of war and the simple beauties of life. As such, it somewhat defies conventional subject categorization other than really well-done fiction. This book just clicked for me: the gorgeous prose, the unexpected and welcome humor, the depth of description of the Blitz and bucolic Fox Corner, the glorious (the dazzling and dueling Sylvie and Izzy especially) female characters of the Todd family (and their solid yet less interesting male family members), the constant literary references and the way major questions about life's meaning and importance are handled quietly, thoughtfully, artfully. While not a perfect novel, I was completely swept away by Life After Life and this is something I'll re-read in the future. Overall, I found so much humanity in this read, and it was so well-written, I couldn't help but be moved and informed and entertained by it. This is a novel that also rifled through my fears of my (and everyone's) mortality, yet also left a pervading sense of optimism, or at least perseverance in the face of the inevitable. I'd rate it 4.5 stars, but round up to 5 stars for the final feelings I had upon finishing it: contentment, satisfaction, and a light regret there wasn't more.

I can't easily go onto the next book (and I have three other holds in from the library at the same time so this presents a problem) because I can't stop thinking about Life After Life. In fact, I couldn't sleep last night for thinking of the book and finally needed to read under the covers for over an hour in the middle of the night before I could sleep. I imagine I'm not alone in letting my mind wander on flights of fancy in the land of \"what-if\". What if I'd gone to a different college? Accepted this job offer instead of that one? Broke up with that boyfriend sooner? etc. In many ways, this novel is Kate Atkinson's exploration of that idea, beginning in the first moments of Ursula Beresford Todd's life. What if the doctor can't arrive at the birth due to a snowstorm? What if he gets there just in time? What if he doesn't get there, and Ursula's mother takes matter into her own hands? What if she doesn't? Key moments in Ursula's life play themselves out over and over. For her, time is a palimpsest, her life a page that has appeared, been scraped clean, and then written again, but each writing is a little different, an added comma, a missing exclamation point. As we read scenes over again, we gain perspective, depth, not into the possibilities of plot but the possibilities of character as well. We gain deeper insight into the secondary characters and Atkinson also makes something of a nature versus nurture argument. In one version of her life, 16 year old Ursula allows a big, loutish boy to kiss her against her will. This sets her up for a lifetime to be used and abused by domineering men. But in the version where she hits the lout and gets away, she lives her life on her own terms, able to define her relationships with men, rather than being defined by them. The time and setting of this novel, 1910 through WWII, England and Germany, are supposed to play a pivotal role and although they do in the end, I was far more interested in the fleeting small changes from version to version of Ursula's life.

I'm less mad at Atkinson, who thought she had a good idea, than I am at the idiotic book critics slobbering all over this nonsensical novel.  Many people have compared this book to the movie Groundhog Day where the main character lives the same day over and over. In Life After Life, the main character is born, lives a varying length of time, dies, and is born again. The difference between Groundhog Day and this book is that in the movie the main character learns something from living again and again. In Life After Life, the main character learns nothing. Oh, she has some vague feelings and the occasional premonition thanks to her past lives, but does she learn from one life to the next? Not really. Mostly she lives a little longer each time because she recognizes a stray dog, meets some different than she expected, and so forth. Nothing happens for any particularly discernible reason.  Until late in one storyline, our protagonist meets a very bad figure from history. Hmm, where could this end up going? The woman quickly dies in this storyline, and the book reverts back to the usual storylines without the big bad. Until suddenly in one life, after exhibiting virtually no awareness that she is being born over and over, the woman apparently realizes she is meant to take out the big bad, and suddenly decides to do so. Huh? And this critical development, apparently the point of the whole book, takes two or three pages, then she's dead again, and we're back to her being born over and over.  Why did she suddenly know what she was meant to do about the big bad? No idea. The author gives us no clue. Why is she born again after completing her apparent reason for being born. No idea. The author gives us no idea. Sh*t just happens apparently.  Kate Atkinson writes perfectly fine prose. Often its quite good, and she captures wartime England very convincingly and even gives us engaging characters.

That was the first time she died...I loved how Kate Atkinson built this story through seemingly insignificant details. As the reincarnations progress, layers are added upon layers, so that by the end of this tale, it is a rich tapestry of events, emotions and possibilities.I was surprised by the open-endedness of this story. I feel like Atkinson wrote a tale that reads like real life- it has the meanings that we assign it. Nothing more, nothing less.I listened to the audiobook of Life After Life and it was very good. A few times, I wished that I had the physical book in front of me so that I could double check a date or detail. Other than that, the narration was excellent.This story has me wondering about life, reincarnation and all of it. If, as so many world religions say, there are parts of us that are immortal, wouldn't we all go a bit bonkers after millennia of existence? Would we get bored of it? Would we ever choose to not come back? What's the bigger picture?Anyway, this book will make you wonder, question and dream about existence. Which, in my mind, is one of the highest functions of a book.Recommended for fans of historical fiction, spirituality and life itself.

She's killed immediately after shooting Hitler, but then, understandably, there's a new life, what appears to be one of the better ones she's had, since her brother Teddy and the love of his life both survived. And on the very last page, there's her birth date again, but instead of reading about Ursula being born (again) we only read about the midwife who wasn't able to make it to her birth. Some readers think that means that Ursula was done being reborn and that the good life is also her last life, which sounds really nice. But I just don't see a logical reason for it being the last of her lives, other than perhaps this conversation between Ursula and her brother Teddy: \"What if we had a chance to do it again and again,\" Teddy said, \"until we finally did get it right. Wouldn't that be wonderful?\"Ursula: \"I think it would be exhausting.\"Is there a providence or power in this book that gives Ursula a rest when she finally \"gets it right\"? If so, I didn't see any other evidence for that in the story. In fact, a happy ending seems incongruous with the rest of this rather grim book.

I think that's a question many people have asked themselves in their lives. It's one of the biggest \"what ifs\" of the last century. And in this novel, it was the plot point I was most in denial about. I was fearful that such a question as the premise of a novel--as the opening scene shows our main character, Ursula Todd, shooting Hitler--would be gimmicky. But we are immediately transported back to 1910 when Ursula is born on a cold snowy night. And dies. Then she's born again, makes it a few years, and dies. And so on and so forth, the novel proceeds.We follow Ursula as she grows up in rural England during the first and second world wars. She's from an eclectic family, with many close siblings, an adoring father, and infuriating aunt. There's a strong sense of the pastoral, of the importance of nature. And really I think in a way, this novel is a love letter to England's resilience. It's also almost solely about Ursula's agency. Atkinson is commenting, through so many diverging narratives, on the opportunities of women during this time period, and how Ursula, through her decisions, ultimately shapes her future and the futures of those with whom she comes in contact. The plot to kill Hitler recedes so far into the background we nearly forget it exists for much of the book. I think what's most successful about this story is also what makes it so frustrating. It's shadowy and inconclusive. We see Ursula die, and we just want to watch her live a full life and do it right. But when we finally do, we are left with ambiguity. In the end, I appreciate the story's opaqueness. It was extremely thought provoking and left me with so much to chew on. Though there were sections that dragged, in hindsight they're relevant and necessary to the story, so I can forgive their pacing. And after all that's said, I did read it in two days; I just couldn't put it down. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "\u201cThere is a fine line between living and dying,\u201d a character observes in Kate Atkinson\u2019s new novel. And it does certainly seem to be the case here, in the midst of two world wars, during the Great Influenza, at the beginning of the twentieth century in Britain. Characters come close to death, and some do not escape it: alternate histories are woven together until we are not really sure what is true. And this is the message. \u201cHistory is all about \u2018what ifs\u2019\u201d a character says late in the novel. More to the point here, perhaps, is that fiction, and this fiction in particular, is all about \u2018what ifs\u2019. This is my first experience with what I would call a literary mash-up. Mash-up is a relatively new concept in literature that was borrowed from music where two or more songs are combined, usually by laying the vocal track of one song over the instrumental track of another. Wikipedia defines a literary mash up as taking a pre-existing work of fiction, often a classic, and combining perhaps thirty or forty percent of it with a vampire, werewolf, or horror genre. Atkinson has taken \u201cclassic history,\u201d which is the F\u00fchrer\u2019s horror story, and overlaid many possible stories (love stories, family histories, employment possibilities) so that outcomes in some cases are different for individuals, but not, that we can see, in the larger history. Stories cascade upon one another, all centered around a single family, indeed, a single person, Ursula, who we meet in the first chapter and who succeeds, we think at first, in killing the F\u00fchrer.\u201cDon\u2019t you wonder sometimes, \u201c Ursula said. \u201cIf just one small thing had been changed, in the past, I mean. If Hitler had died at birth, or if someone had kidnapped him as a baby and brought him up in\u2014I don\u2019t know, say a Quaker household\u2014surely things would be different.\u201dThe juxtaposition of the chapters makes one remember those times when we stare into the unknowingness of the future and wonder what it will hold for us\u2026and once there, looking back at the innocence of the early years, when we proceeded with our lives as though we had any control at all. Which brings me to a larger observation in this novel and in Atkinson\u2019s fiction in general: oftentimes Atkinson\u2019s characters are not agents of change, but reagents, possibly causing a chain reaction when they are introduced, possibly having no discernible impact at all. \u201cMost people muddled through events and only in retrospect realized their significance. The F\u00fchrer was different, he was consciously making history for the future.\u201d Sometimes there are exceptional people, but even they cannot escape that possibility that \u201cone thing\u201d could change everything. Therein lie our power, and the power of the fiction writer.The title, Life After Life, points to those lives impacted by another\u2019s life, or a close escape from death, or lives that continue after another has died, or simply the alternate histories we all might have if \u201cone thing had been different.\u201d When the book and the stories were drawing to a close, I admit I didn\u2019t want to get to the end. I didn\u2019t want another person to die unexpectedly. I didn\u2019t want Ursula to grow older. I didn\u2019t want to know which story was true. So, you see, I was caught, too."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I love the perspective this book gave me on the meanings of mortality and clues about how to make sense of all the choices life is made of. I experienced a lot of difficulty over digesting what this book is \u201cabout\u201d for the first 100 pages or so, but ultimately was glad I chose just to ride with it without worrying about what it \u201cmeans\u201d. The meaning part filtered in on my personal river. Call it speculative fiction if you will, but the book involves an alternative reality plot I don\u2019t mind calling science fiction (but like Atwood, I am sure Atkinson would not want her readership limited by shelving her book under that category). In the very first pages, Ursula dies at birth in the winter of 1910 in rural England, but then a second time around the doctor arrives before the snowstorm gets bad and she is saved. The very first scene in the book tells us that one fate involves Ursula trying to change history by killing an early Hitler in Bavaria in 1930. In between there are a number of other unfortunate ends and restarts, with many paths leading to long stretches in London and surrounds during the Blitz in World War 2. There it is common for Ursula to serve bravely as a volunteer in night-time bomb response squads while holding a day job as a government cleric in Bletchley Park processing data on bomb damage and casualties. Other life paths lead to alternative careers, married vs. unmarried situations, and places of residence, which in turn are associated with different fates for friends, lovers, and family members. What to make of this odd form of reincarnation back into one\u2019s own life? I like the philosophical playfulness Atkinson weaves around her premise. In a preface she quotes a Nietzsche passage which raises the question of whether being forced to relive one\u2019s life would be a curse rather than a blessing of a god-like power. Another quote from Ursula\u2019s brother begs the reader to ponder: What if we had a chance to do it again and again until we finally did get it right? Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful? At one point, Ursula\u2019s trouble over all her d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu states leads her mother to take her to a shrink interested in Buddhism. Their work leads Ursula to consider how the flow of time back on itself can conform metaphorically to the Ouroborous icon of a snake eating its own tail. At another point, the ten-year old Ursula recognizes what is happening is more like a \u201cpalimpsest\u201d, which a dictionary tells me is like recycling \u201cparchment from which writing has been erased to make room for another text\u201d. Other metaphors abound in the book. This one that had me scratching my head a bit: What is it Heraclitis says? One cannot step in the same river twice. The more accurate way of phrasing it would be \u2018You can step in the same river but the water will always be new.\u2019Expectations some readers may get from the early sections that that they will be treated to a fantastical entertainment similar to the movie \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d or an alternative history thriller are not fulfilled. Instead, much of the book is a rich evocation of family life of the time. We learn much about Ursula as one of five kids in a well-to-do family of a banker, Hugh, and a loving mother, Sylvie, living at a rural estate outside of London. Later, during the Blitz coverage, it is the courage and resilience of ordinary people that dominate the stage with Ursula. But the realism typical of historical fiction is cast in an \u201cotherworldly\u201d light by Ursula\u2019s effective power to cheat death. I ended up worrying less about her fate and relatively more about the friends, lovers, family, and even the strangers she seeks to save on emergency response squad. I got some of the same extra dose of identification with the \u201ccontemps\u201d in Connie Willis\u2019 coverage of the Blitz in her \u201cBlackout\u201d and \u201cAll Clear\u201d books about time travelling historians and a similar distancing sense over the reality of historians\u2019 fate. In Willis\u2019 books, some kind of barrier prevents any interventions from the future from changing history substantially, as common in time travel sci fi since H.G. Wells. With Atkinson\u2019s book, Ursula\u2019s choices seem open to effect large changes, but in practice there is some strong channeling along certain pathways in her life. The status of the reality left behind when her life is reset is unclear. I like to think her pathways through time reflect a portrayal of current physics theories of alternative universes splitting off at various choice points, although this possible interpretation is not raised in the narrative. In another way, the book gave me some of that eerie sense of empowerment over fate I used to get with early role playing games. In particular, I got some nostalgia for a text-only game popular before computer graphics matured called \u201cTrinity\u201d, which required piecing together various clues to set history on a path to prevent a nuclear World War 3 from occurring. Each mistake led to \u201cgame over\u201d and a chance to try again. Of course this analogy only goes so far. The big picture for me is that in the absence of any reset, we better play the game right in the first place.

'Time is a construct, in reality everything flows, no past or present, only the now,' he said. It would have been a scary thought for Sylvie, who refused to drink the tea offered by Dr Kellet from his Russian samovar. Any tea out of anything else than a china teapot was undrinkable according to her own believes.'How gnomic,' Sylvie said stiffly.Dr Kellet steepled his hands an propped his chin on them. 'You know,' he said to Ursula, 'I think we shall get on very well. Would you like a biscuit?'There was one thing that puzzled her. The photograph of Guy, lost at Arras in his cricketing whites was missing from the side table.

'And memories are sometimes in the future.'Ursula Beresford Todd was a witness ...COMMENTI was a bit busy while reading the book. Too many interruptions and way too many late night efforts to catch up with it. Hence my really big confusion. I need to reread this book in retrospect.I only grasped the story almost right at the end. 1910. The birth and death of Ursula. Before that I was questioning the meaning of the tales, which never lead to any endings. I questioned my desire to keep on reading a senseless, yet very well-written set of novellas. The only common denominator was Ursula as protagonist in them all. Her family constantly featured in all of them, but each time with different outcomes. Each segment ended with 'Darkness fell'. It was confusing to say the least. No forewarning of any kind. What if... \"What if we had the chance to do it again and again \u2026 until we finally get it right?\" asks one of the characters near the end. Life after Life is about being given that chance.I'm borrowing from the \n\n\nIndependent UK\n\n\n review by Rachel Hore to provide a glimps into the novel: (this review saved my life after reading the book! Read it before you make an attempt! I did not. :-))Overall, it's safe to say that the early narrative follows the following course: Ursula is the third child of Sylvie and Hugh Todd, brought up in an idyllic English upper-middle-class country home, sister to the soulless and pragmatic Maurice and jolly-hockey-sticks Pamela. She's an engaging girl, but quirky, with a tendency to fits of what her despairing mother calls \"d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu\". Teddy, the sunny family darling, arrives soon after, then, finally, Jimmy, conceived after Hugh's return from Flanders Fields. Swelling the dramatis personae are disreputable Aunt Izzie \u2013 ripe to play a pivotal role in many of Ursula's crises \u2013 Mrs Glover the dour cook, and Bridget, the plain-faced Irish maidservant.Beyond this basic set up, all bets are off...Eva Braun and Hitler would appear in the fog like bomb-dust. Real and clear. A brutal war in graphic detail would populate a future spilling into the past and present. A, kind-of, biographical novel emerged from it all. A very good one. An excellent one. Towards the end time moved backwards. All the time. And forward again with leaps and bounds. Two world wars featured strongly. I escaped, confused, but unscathed. An atmospheric, suspenseful, richly-textured, literary tale nestled in my foggy brain. It could have been five brilliant stars if I was able to grasp this light touch to a grizzly period in Britain and Germany's history better. Thanks to my good mood four stars celebrate an excellent author at work here. A challenging experience. Worth the read though.PS: GR friends made the experience so much more enlightening with comments like these in their brilliant reviews:Will Byrnes: She seems to be born again more than an entire congregation of fundamentalist Christians, or, maybe more likely a band of Buddhists, as she seems to pick up a bit of wisdom, a bit of strength with each reincarnation. I counted 15 passings-on, but sure, I could have missed one or two. The lady must have G. Reaper on her autodial.And Steve: Typically I\u2019m suspicious of devices that quantum physics, even at its strangest, can\u2019t explain...Marita:  Ursula may have a vivid imagination, but so has Kate Atkinson. She seems to explore a zillion what if scenarios as Ursula is given life after life in Life after Life.Don't despair.

A palimpsest is also the perfect metaphor for Kate Atkinson\u2019s luminous novel. Its multiple layers of theme and plot pile up like shadows, visible through the translucent onion-skin of imagination. It is a novel of faerie tales\u2014the fox, the wolf, and little girls snatched while walking through the woods. It is about the brutal realities of war\u2014Atkinson brilliantly captures the interminable months of the Blitz, where nightly bombings are endured with aplomb and scooping up bucketsful of your neighbor\u2019s flesh is just what you do to get on to the next day. It is a story of a family\u2014a familiar motif in Atkinson\u2019s literary worlds\u2014with a set of messy, vexing, endearing characters whose personalities remain constant throughout the crazy quilt of this narrative, even if their outcomes change, depending upon the version of life they are living. Ursula Todd is born at Fox Corner on a snowy night in February 1910, the third child of an upper-middle class family ensconced in the genteel English countryside. She dies at birth. She lives, just barely. She drowns as a toddler. She is rescued at the last minute, clutched by the hand of an amateur painter before the current sweeps her out to sea. She is taken by the Spanish flu just days after Armistice. She is raped on her sixteenth birthday and dies after a botched abortion. She is kissed tenderly by the neighbor boy, a Sweet Sixteen gift beyond her wildest hope. She marries an English psychopath who murders her. She marries a German intellectual. She can never have children. She has a little girl named Frieda who becomes the pet of Eva Braun. She is trapped in Germany during the war and dies from her countrymen\u2019s bombs. She survives the terror during and the deprivation after World War II in London, rising through the ranks of British civil service to become a model for working women in the 1960\u2019s. She assassinates Hitler in 1930, becoming a martyr for peace and the prevention of a Holocaust that no one could believe possible in the desperate years after the Great War. The first snippets of life and death and life again are jarring. Atkinson opens the door wider each time until you are inside the maze and there is no turning back. But she doesn\u2019t abandon you to aimless wandering. Through the constancy of the characters, you follow the crumbs of her tense and nimble plotting. Her writing, as always, is sheer pleasure to read, with lovely and supple language. She balances the queer and violent with humor and tenderness, leaving her lipstick on the glass with those particular Atkinson markers: affection for children, dogs, and an essential Britishness that mixes poignancy with a wry self-regard.Atkinson leaves room for the reader and the characters to approach reality on their own terms. Ursula shifts with each life, responding to a sense that if she just did this, something fundamental will change. Is she aware that she is reliving her life? Are her choices conscious, or is it an awareness buried deep inside her, a sixth sense that emerges as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? You\u2019ve simply got to read this for yourself for the answers. But don\u2019t expect any. The more I think about this book\u2014several days now after reluctantly closing the back cover\u2014the more in awe I am of one of my favorite authors. Kate Atkinson has crafted a lyrical rendering of metaphysics and a brave manipulation of narrative structure that is at heart a wonderful story\u2014albeit with layers as delicate and impermanent as a croissant\u2019s and as delicious to consume.

As far as an ARC goes it's fairly fancy, but the double ended rose? Blah. The British publishers obviously know a thing or two about selling books, put a fucking fox on the cover! Foxes sell shit. Or use the magical looking little girl looking out over the coming future of a bombed out England, that one works well, too. But seriously, foxes sell books.I'm mostly joking, or maybe I'm just jealous. I have (had) plans for this to be the first part of a triptych of reviews, with a review of Freewill by Sam Harris making up the centerpiece. I don't know if that is going to happen though. Writing reviews is like pulling teeth for me lately. The basic premise of this book is that the main character keeps dying. Over and over and over again, starting with her birth when she is initially strangled by her umbilical cord. There isn't too much story in that first life of hers. But the second time around the accidental qualities of life take a different turn and Ursula survives being born only to eventually come to face more lethal life experiences. After a few more tries one could say this happens, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopoiD..., and then a whole bunch of new existential problems begin to arise (sorry I couldn't resist this one, immature as it may be). On the surface this book sounds like it could be infuriatingly gimmicky. A girl keeps dying and re-living her life, trying to successfully navigate her new life without having any knowledge of her past lives except for feelings of deja vu and impending doom that arise from time to time. If it were just a gimmicky book there is no way that Kate Atkinson could have written a five hundred page book that continued to get better and better as it went along. What's fairly remarkable (or so I think) is the manner she tells the story of Ursula and her many many lives. Atkinson is amazing at weaving back story into the ongoing narrative, filling in the details needed to differentiate the various trajectories Ursula and her lives take while continuing to propel the story forward and not making the whole project feel as boringly redundant I imagine having to relive my own life over and over and over again would be. Another fairly remarkable thing, although it shouldn't have been to me, and it shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did, being that this same feature has surprised me while I was reading the two other Kate Atkinson also, is how smart her books are. They are deceivingly smart. I don't know if it's the covers, or if it's the almost breezy style she writes in that you might think is more suitable for a light hearted romantic comedy, but she has an unassuming whollop of an over-hand right of smarts that you just don't see coming until it's laid you out on your ass and you realize wow, she just doesn't know her shit but she knows how to really work into her books without waving her arms around and screaming look how clever I am.But if you don't like your books all that intellectually clever, rest assured she is so unassuming about it that you can easily just get caught up in her story-telling prowess and have a great time with the book just on that level.What I found pretty fascinating about the whole concept of this book is the way it sort of puts a spin on the whole eternal recurrence theme of Nietzsche (which you are kind of asked to confront, since it is one of the opening epigrams in the book). You can also think about Heraclitus, too. Although Atkinson doesn't mention him directly until near the end of the book when she has Ursula correct someone for making the normal, pedestrian, and slightly innacurate comment about stepping in the river and all of that, with a more nuanced and interesting translation. I don't know about you, but when I think of the Nietzsche passages about the eternal recurrence, I remember the first thing that popped into my mind was reliving your life exactly the same, over and over and over again. The same joys. The same agonies. The same successes and failures. The sort of thing that if you could watch as an observer you'd cringe having to see replay over and over again (or maybe you wouldn't cringe because the life your watching is awesome and not a series of awful half-baked decisions, stupid ideas and embarrassing failures). What if the eternal recurrence were more like that little simple life program that Richard Dawkins is always using for experiments and examples in his books? Where you start off with this basic thing, with it's handful of different proteins and it runs over and over again and shows all the different paths that could have been taken, all by chance and circumstances outside of the control of the non-sentient simple life form that he is mimicking. What if the eternal recurrence is like playing and endless series of chess games with someone, neither of you are really that good, and you both start with the same opening each time and would seem to attack and counter each other in the same boring way each time but as the game runs on each one becomes it's own slightly unique version and the endings can range from being fairly similar to drastically different (I used to wonder this when I played chess over and over again with my friend Chris, neither of us were very good, neither of us were very inventive and the games always started the same but things would happen even though I doubt either of us really ever learned anything or were consciously trying to deviate from each of our standard goals and rough blueprint of how to achieve those goals). But this isn't eternal recurrence, one, or I could say. If you could relive your life, why would it be the same even if you did nothing differently? What about all of the other things that happen, for reasons or by purely accidental means that drastically alter things. Think about the idea that number of possible chess moves in a game is greater than the number of atoms in the universe (or so says Nate Silver, and I'm going to nod along (this review to come)), and that is a fairly simple 64 square board with 32 pieces that have fairly limited manners in which they can operate, and then think about all the possibilities that go into anything at all happening to you, all the things that make up your past, all the people, events, things. The weather, the way non-human creatures act, all the things that go on in the world, any of which could touch on your life in some way either directly or indirectly and then think that if you got to relive your life all of those things could possibly all happen the same way again, with no change. You could step into the same life again and again as if it were Heraclitus's river, and it might look the same but the water, the stuff that makes up the life, would be different each and every time. Even if it might only be in the smallest details that the differences lie. And those small differences could lead to who knows what. You know, butterflies flapping their wings and storms and all that shit. All that nonsense aside. This book is great. You should read it. Book report done. (if this does make up part of a trilogy of reviews, the second one will be The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver and the third Freewill by Sam Harris, if you are familiar with either of those books you might have an idea of the shallowly profound path I'm aiming for.)"}], "description": "What if you could live again and again, until you got it right?
