At under 200 pages, and around 4 hrs. of audio, this was a quick and entertaining \"book\". It was funny and endearing enough to hold my attention, while not being emotional enough to consume my thoughts. This is a great \"light\" read if you're recovering from a book hangover.Madison has always loved her older brother's best friend, Chase. Everyone knows it, except for him. Guys can be clueless like that. With the exception of the events of one drunken night, Chase has always kept Madison at arms-length.When there is a mix-up at the resort where Madison's older brother's wedding party is staying, the two are stuck sharing a cabin. Needless to say, this leads to some rather interesting situations and plenty of sexual tension. The more they try to fight their attraction, the more interesting things get.Of course, there is a little contrived drama along the way. It was predictable, as was this entire story. Eventually, they figure things out and we get the HEA we wanted.While this was nothing groundbreaking or deeply emotional, it was a nice, straightforward love story. It was very short and served as a nice \"filler\" between other more intense books. I liked it."}, {"userName": "Annie Brewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5315988-annie-brewer", "userReview": "*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT* YOU'RE BEING WARNED.GOD DAMN FUCKING SHIT. There I said it. I just read my first adult book and I didn't even know it. Okay, by the title of the book I should have guessed it. But let's not talk about my roots please, I'd rather discuss this book.First of all, once again I was still out of town when I checked on GR and saw a friend had read this book. I had no idea what this book was about or who was the author or anything. I go on and read the synopsis...and yes it still didn't sink in that it was adult. Fuck, I'm slow, sue me! Anyway, so I read my friends' review and at the mere mention of JENNIFER L ARMENTROUT.....but secretly J. Lynn for this book, I was ALL OVER THIS SHIT! I marked it to read. And since I had no internet connection being that I was at my grandparents house who don't believe in internet for the love of God, I was pissed. I couldn't download it on my nook yet. Fuck me, I have to wait. I was dying..after reading the reviews I wanted that book then. I couldn't go anywhere that had reception either because my nook was dead. Just my luck. So the first thing I do when I get home is download that son of a bitch on my barnes and noble account so once it was charged, I'd go to town on that book. OH. DEAR. SWEET. BABY. JESUS. Okay, so Daemon who?? No wait, that's not fair...he'd have sex with Katy if the YA genre allowed it to go that far. Okay, so he's still my Daemon. *blows Daemon kisses*When I first read this book, I didn't know what to expect. I was floored. Eventually it sunk in that this was NOT YA. No way, it couldn't be. I mean Jen used the word \"cock\" \"dick\" \"hard on\" so many times, I was like \"fucking hell, just get it on already....hell I did.\" Oh did I ever. Gawd. Jesus. This was so very detailed and raunchy...and PERFECT. I mean, it's Jennifer Armentrout for Christ's sake. She could do no wrong. So I was planning on meeting Christian Grey for my first adult sexy sexcapades....but instead I meet Chase Gamble. Holy Hell. He set my vagina in a frenzy. Shit! First off, there is something sexy about that name to begin with...but add on a hot, sexual beast and good God. He made me weak in the knees....and of course many other places as well. So upon Maddie's brother's wedding...she's of course Maid of Honor. Her longtime heartthrob crush who's been more like a brother to her in the protective sense....Chase *HARD ON* Gamble is Mitch's Best Man. Damn. That's a hard pill to swallow. They had one passionate night in college on the couch of his new nightclub's office, which left Maddie brokenhearted after telling her that he was drunk and that shit wasn't happening again.Seeing Chase again after some time was as difficult and almost a slap in the face, reminder of her strong feelings that never dissipated. Everyone knows they are meant to be together. So why aren't they?Because Chase won't get off his high horse and shove his \"I'm like my cheating bastard father who will hurt you in the end\" spiel up his ass. Really, he's nothing like his father who cheated on his mother and left her with 3 boys to raise on her own. They turned out to be great guys, even if they feel differently. I loved Chad. He was hilarious. And Chandler was pretty bad ass too. Their bond was really tight. But they grew up in the Daniels household, they spent more time with Mitch and Maddie and her parents than with their mother. They became a big family. So Chase always looked after her like a protective older brother. It was sweet and she enjoyed it...except she wanted more. Alot more. Friendship with Chase Gamble was never enough for Maddie. But he complicated everything.In the scheme of things, they kept getting locked in places and pushed together as it was obvious the family revolted against them to make them realize they were meant to be together. They actually had to share a cabin during the wedding weekend. There was a mix up and only one cabin left....THE HONEYMOON SUITE at that. Damn...what more of a sign did that sexy man need. But he didn't want her to become just another one of his conquests. He truly cared about her, he was just afraid it was more than that....the L word. They got locked in a wine cellar and OMG...that scene was off the chain. It was sex sex sex....oh dear God I feel it between my thighs....*closes eyes* Okay. *composed* Whew. So, after that their attraction and connection deepens and he realizes he can't keep his dick from erecting every time she's near and it drives him wild. He offers a proposition....one night of hot and unforgettable sex...and then they can go back to being \"normal\" again.Are you fucking kidding me? I was a little angry with him then...and so was Maddie. How dare he play her like that. Once his brother talks some Oprah sense into him...it becomes perfectly clear to him that he's not his father. He's a decent guy who is capable of thinking with his heart...not just his cock. Oh Lord, I think there was a nuclear war that broke out....Hallelujah! He admitted it. Then following was....um WOW, one of the most arousing and holy shit Jenn is brilliant. I can't think. My vag...oh my word...she I mean it like, well then and I was...see, I can't form a coherent sentence. That scene had all sorts of shit shooting out of me. Oh God, that was too personal. Erase that....I mean skip over that. Haha, my reviews get pretty explicit...about as explicit as Armentrout's sex scenes.Well, the day after the sex of all sex scenes things get more complicated...and I won't say what happens next. You've got to read this...if you think Daemon is a sex crazed alien, God I can only imagine how he would be if he were to get sex Katy up. Mmmmmmm, pleasant thoughts. So, after reading this my eyes filled with tears. God, I'm such a baby. But I loved it...of course the last 10 pages I was sitting there going \"What the hell just happened? OMG, this is crazy...over that? But why didn't they? She didn't. But no, he did not! No, he didn't. Huh, I'm so confused.\" Yea that was me...my eyes wide and mouth open ready to like hurl my nook at the window. But instead, I kept pushing through and reading. It was so good. Wow, Jennifer never ceases to amaze me with her awesomeness!!! I can't wait to read more of her erotic pieces...if she continues. Cause HOT DAMN she excels in the adult world...and we already knew she kicks ass in YA. Seriously, a Jennifer Armentrout fan??? Pick this book up!!!!"}, {"userName": "\u2605Ruth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7218978-ruth", "userReview": "Wow I am so in the minority right now it's not even funny.Let me start by saying that I enjoy Jennifer's writing style especially in Obsidian and I also love a good steamy romance.But unfortunately with this I felt like I'd read it all before & better.I know this was a novella but I've read novella's before & been able to connect with the characters for eg Connected.I was so tired of hearing how humiliated & rejected the h (I can't remember her name, it's like i wiped it from my memory or something) felt & how hopelessly in love she was with Chase. As for Chase...yeah he didn't exactly set my world on fire.After reading the first few chapters, waiting & waiting to be sucked into the story I gave up & just started skimming (I hate to not finish a book). It was inevitable that the two would get together & then misunderstand each other then get back together..it was SO predictable. And to be honest I didn't really care either way.So many of my goodreads friends who have read this have absolutely loved it so it is obviously just me, maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind to read this or something I don't know, but it just didn't do it for me."}, {"userName": "Sheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6039696-sheryl", "userReview": "Jennifer L.

Some of you may be confused as to why I'm talking about Ms Armentrout when this book is written by J. Lynn... well that's Jennifer's pen name for her adult books! When I found out that she was writing a story for Entangled Publishings' Indulgence line, i almost died... most probably from the anticipation. I love the new Indulgence line and couple that with Ms Armentrout (who hands down created THE most famous alien, that HOT, SEXY, GOD; Daemon Black) made me ALREADY give this story 5 stars before I read it!!Now that we got that out of the way, I'm just going to say that I LOVED Tempting The Best Man! Humor, snark and one SMOKIN' HOT lead in Chase, kept me furiously turning the pages. Oh and did I mention that the dirty, hot smexing made me want to stick my head in the freezer to cool off... Awesome stuff and here's to hoping that Chad will get his own story :)Welcome to world of ADULT romance, Ms Lynn aka Ms Armentrout, please stay around, because just like you rocked the YA world, by the looks of this story, you're about to rock the ADULT one too!"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "I'm working my way through sickness right now, so I'll probably lazy review this one. Either way, I'll be back to my rambling and sad attempts at humor in my reviews tomorrow. In case you didn't know, this author is the same person as Jennifer L. Armentrout. While I have had certain \"ethical\" issues with one of Armentrout's series in the past, I can honestly say that I've never had any complaints about her writing. Usually, her stuff is pretty entertaining. She rocks it out in the YAPNR department. So I figured I'd give one of her adult contemps a whirl. After all, Armentrout excels at sexual tension. I was surprised to find out that her adult contemp wasn't all that impressive. Although, I can't really say anything overly negative about Tempting the Best Man. It's not that there was anything bad or unreadable about the book. It's just that everything about this book was standard - from the childhood romance, to the romance terminology which felt like it was lifted from the romance writing handbook, to the setting (whaddya know, they just so happen to be sharing a cabin at a wedding), to the \"you're too good for me,\" spiel, to the \"conflict which wasn't really much of a conflict.\" In short, this book was :Honestly, I think I'd seen this same story done better recently, in Risking It All. That one was only a 3 star read for me, but at least I felt more enthusiastic about parts of it. Chances are, I will still probably read the next Gamble Brothers book. I'd heard that it was better than this one and I know this author can write well when she wants to. Maybe I just found a random book of hers which didn't interest me."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "3.5 StarsChase Gamble and Maddie Daniels have been friends forever. Chase is the best friend of Maddie's brother, Mitch, and the three of them played and hung out even before they started elementary school. Here's the thing though, Maddie has had it bad for Chase ever since she started being interested in boys. Chase, needing to escape family drama was like a fixture at the Daniels' house. He's always been protective of Maddie, held her up on a pedestal. Until one night when they let their feelings show and ended up crossing lines. Chase quickly put an end to that, though. Chase saw how his father treated his mother, cheating, using and then eventually leaving her. Chase fears he's cut from the same mold, so instead of hurting Maddie, he cuts things off. Maddie for her part, had never been so humiliated in her life. She finally gives herself over to Chase, and he rejects her at a crucial moment. Since then, they've barely seen or talked to each other. This is about to change, though, because, Maddie's brother, Mitch, is getting married and they are both in the wedding. He's the best man and she is the maid of honor. The wedding is taking place at a vineyard/inn where the family and bridal party are staying for the whole weekend. Let the drama begin! Somehow, Chase and Maddie end up stuck in the same room, a honeymoon suite, because there's been a mix-up with the reservations. Convenient, right? (I kind of wished this would've been elaborated on more, like was this really a mix-up, or sort of planned by someone well-meaning?) Well, now that they're forced together, the chemistry they've always had can't help but come out. J. Lynn has a talent for writing witty and snarky banter so this was full of funny one-liners and internal commentaries. I love the southern-type comments throughout, like: \"Aww, hell\" and \"Hell to the no!\" This story was told in alternating POVs, Maddie and Chase's. I always love this type of story-telling because you get insight from both sides. I felt bad for Maddie, the way she felt over Chase all those years, not knowing the truth behind his actions. I also felt bad for Chase, selling himself short from fear of turning into his father. No worries, though, things wrap up nicely. I have to say I was a little frustrated with the confusion at the end. I also wished there would have been a little more at the end. This was a pretty short story (172 pages) so I shouldn't be disappointed. For the most part I really enjoyed this. I thought it was a fun mix of cute and spicy. This is my first J. Lynn book but it won't be my last. Another great pick for Smut Monday Club!

Predictable? Yes. Original? Heck no. A fun read? For a light beach read, absolutely. Madison (Maddie) has had a crush on Chase since she was a little girl. Chase is her brother Mitch's best friend, and now his best man in his upcoming wedding. He believes Maddie is too good for him, and off limits since she's the sister of his best friends. But things heat up at Mitch's wedding, and he finds himself struggling to keep his hands to himself.I really did enjoy this little story. It had a good dose of steamy tension, and I didn't mind all of the contrived 'alone time' scenes. My only issue came toward the end. The 'big misunderstanding' was an eye-roller with too much over-acting drama, and their lack of being able to act like adults at this stage of their 'friendship' took this down from a 4-star to a 3-star. I do recommend it as a light beach read with a good dose of steam, just don't take the characters all that serious."}, {"userName": "Terri \u2665 (aka Mrs. Christian Grey)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6014919-terri-aka-mrs-christian-grey", "userReview": "Quick reviewCover: Likey!

Lynn's sinful little secret is out of the bag, and it is PERFECTION!! I have always been a huge fan of Jennifer's amazing writing, and her steamy scenes in the Lux and Covenant series never disappoint, but clearly her talents in the romance genre have gone underestimated!! I was expecting this to be good, but I wasn't expecting to be completely blown away with an unforgettable story. Whew, my heart is still racing and I finished this last night!!!!Tempting the Best Man is absolutely the perfect recipe for a phenomenal romance story, down to the last details. There aren't many romance novels that have everything just right, there's often something about it that falls a bit short. Sometimes the story is weak or the characters are flat, and sometimes the chemistry just isn't believable. I can honestly say that this book was not suffering from any of these pitfalls, and it was so addicting to read that I literally tore through it in the 3 hours after I bought it. It has everything I love about the romance genre wrapped up in a sexy red ribbon!!!Now for what I loved about this book...where do I begin??!! First off, I have to say my favorite romance stories are the ones where the main characters have a history, whether it be a friendship or a heart-wrenching break up. It adds so much more depth, and Jennifer created the perfect story with the plot in Tempting. I just loved that there was this unspoken chemistry and destined love story that had been growing between them for so long. The flashbacks to their childhood when Chase protected Maddie and she swooned over him were just so unbelievably sweet. My heart still races just thinking about it, this was set up so perfectly to evolve into the romance that could set fire in a rainstorm!! Jennifer really puts you through the whole nine yards of emotions with this story, and I LOVED every second of it! Your heart races, gets ripped apart, races again, is stomped on and wrung out, races again, then is hammered into with a dozen large rusty nails before being allowed to finally beat again...whew!! *takes deep breath*The characters in Tempting were so spot-on, I was really quite impressed how well even the secondary characters were handled. Madison and Chase are most definitely now up there with Ana and Christian as my top romance couples!! She was the perfect heroine, bruised from her past with Chase but still holding on to that undeniable spark. She wasn't whiny or self-depricating, she was just hurt and scared to have to face the one man she'd always loved. Okay, petrified! And Chase, oh bestill my rapidly racing, beating out of my chest heart!!! J had me panting over this sexy specimen at every turn, he was most definitely sex on a stick!! And that sexy bravado he used to hide his true feelings was so damned hot!!! They were both so infuriatingly stubborn sometimes, I was just glued to the screen to see where the next twist would lead them! And the rest of the Gamble boys were just as delish, even though they were naughty...but we all love a bad boy, right??!! All of the brothers and Maddie's family were really cute with their teasing banter (yes, we get some of J's infamous sarcastic hilarity!!) and how they tried to make Maddie and Chase wake up and smell the giant carafe of \"get together already!!\" The way they all knew it was destined to be and were determined to get the point across with the cleverly timed \"accidents\" just made me love them all so much more!! So yes, this was a smoking hot romance story and I've yet to mention those scenes we all hold our breath waiting for, but it's not because they weren't memorable! No, quite the opposite, Jennifer manages to build up the steaming pot of sexiness to the point you wonder if your heart can take any more!! Holy s*&t, hopefully my iPad still works after all the steam coming off it last night!!!! WOW!! There was just a flaming blaze of sparks going off between Maddie and Chase every time they were in the same room, and when they gave in to their undeniable chemistry it was &^*%ing HOT!! Oh, Chase just made me melt over and over again, and I loved how Maddie reacted to him!!! I would normally insert a *biting knuckles* comment here, but I think I gnawed them raw last night as I was reading this!! Gah!!!I have to say a huge congratulations to Jennifer, because it's well-deserved and I was so completely impressed by this story. Bravo, miss J. Lynn, you have proven without a doubt how versatile your talent for writing unforgettable stories is!!"}, {"userName": "B\u00fc\u015fra \u00d6zt\u00fcrk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31403166-b-ra-zt-rk", "userReview": "\u015eeymo\u015fdan g\u00f6rd\u00fcm 1 vermi\u015f.

I found the story very rushed, Chase and Maddie weren't very functional either as individuals or as a couple and I found their behavior quite predictable. There were no heart racing or emotional moments for me in this book. They both made a lot of stupid mistakes which I have very little patience for. But if you like 'hate-to-love-each-other' kind of relationships, then you might like it.It had me smiling in the beginning and a little at the end but I found Chase and Maddie's behavior in the middle quite frustrating. Chase has serious 'I'm not good enough for her' issues, a bit of a man-whoring past, but desperately wants to not screw up with her. Maddie has wanted him since she was a kid but always felt like he didn't see her in any way other than a kid sister. This leads to a lot of miss - communication but, of course, an eventual HEA.

It was great. It was short too, not so great.Of course it being written by J. Lynn, aka Jennifer L. Armentrout, is a major bonus! She can't do wrong I tell ya.Here we have Madison who's been in love with her brothers BF since she was little. She is now 25 and despite growing up, can't seem to escape being seen as Mitch's younger sister by Chase Gamble, the man of her dreams, her brother's BF, the man she almost shared some smexy time with when she was 21!Getting together for her brother's wedding forces her to re-unite with Chase. Some wild antics later including having to share a room, makes for some sweet and special relationship development--and confusion.This was really good and quite funny too. I loved Maddie and could relate to her as a woman unable to shed her long lasting love for a man seen as untouchable. Chase was wonderful and sweet. He harboured his own feelings and it was nice to see some tables turning towards the end.The only beef I have with the story involves a non-incident that caused quite the problem. This actually created a huge rift between Maddie and Chase but was never adressed. Even as things wrapped up--too quickly imo--they didn't discuss THE incident that, if dealt with at the time could have prevented some unnecessary stress and friction.Anyways, a sweet and completely satisfying story!!

Ladies and gentlemen, behold the summary that started it all:\"Madison Daniels has worshiped her brother's best friend since they were kids. Everyone thinks she and Chase Gamble would make the perfect couple, but there are two major flaws in their logic. 1) Chase has sworn off relationships of any kind, and 2) after blurring the line between friends and lovers for one night four years ago, they can't stop bickering.Forced together for her brother's wedding getaway, Chase and Madison decide to call a truce for the happy couple. Except all bets are off when they're forced to shack up in a tacky 70\u2019s honeymoon suite and survive a multitude of \"accidents\" as the family tries to prove their \"spark\" can be used than for more than fighting. That is, if they don't strangle each other first\u2026\"If that doesn't hook you, well....I suggest seeing a therapist... joke guys, that was a joke......maybe. ANYWAY.Like I said, I loved this book for it's:Humor. Seriously, the arguments between Chase and Maddie had me guffawing into the night, and I wouldn't be surprised if my rentals decided to drop me off in a institute for loco chicks. They fought like cats and dogs,or as Maddie likes to call it, cats and cats, which is true, you know, cause Maddie like a puma! The dialogue, being Miss Armentrout's, was outrageously funny and witty. I don't know how she comes up with this hilarious repartee, but I'm glad she does. For example, what happened when Maddie got drunk...I don't think I've ever read about a female protagonist that acts funnier when drunk then this one. There, now you guys have one more motivation to read this book, aside from the fact that it's awesome-hot-sauce with an extra dose of hot sauce. Drama. I think the drama in this book reached a high-point. Remember, this book was based on a love-hate relationship, so there was bound to be lots of drama, and i loved every word of it. The fights between this couple did not break up their relationship, they only made it stronger. Plus, if it wasn't for the drama, I'm not sure I would've loved it as much as I did, I look for books with content, and once in a while, an occasional sappy love-story. The child-hood romance. This was a great tid-bit to include in this book. I found it sweet and romantic that the lovers had a past to their relationship. Every recollection of their memories together took their relationship a step further. And honestly, I'm just a sucker for child-hood romances, ha ha.The characters:Chase Gamble- OH MY GOSH, I love him. Not just because of his insanely scorching looks and build, but also because of his ability to make a girl melt in the snap of a finger. His over-protectiveness of Maddie had me dying with envy. Why can't I have a guy in my life who loved me a tad too much?? Enough to come racing to my rescue when my car breaks down *wink wink*. Although he was a jerk at times, which only made him hotter (I know I know, I seem to have a jerk-obsession, but who doesn't?LOL), he had a sweet side to him as well. His tortured past only made me want to wrap him up in big hug and pat his back (a bit too old for me to smooch guys, I don't want him arrested for pedophile). When no one was there to look after him, he had his Maddie, the one constant in his life. Sweet bumper-nickles! This calls for an 'AWWW' moment. Maddie Daniels- I found this female protagonist to be absolutely hilarious, witty, combating, smart, and in other word's, a perfect match for our lovely Chase! With her height, I'm surprised she could hold her own in verbal-banter with a grown 6ft (or more) man. I will never underestimate short people again. She didn't take any bull-poopy from Chase, and was always straight-forward with him. Even if it meant insulting him 24/7. But who wouldn't, if he kept throwing up shields whenever some one even came close to conversing with him. She understood Chase and his past and tried to relive him of it, even though it didn't work to its best effect, Chase appreciated Maddie's whole-hearted attempts at trying. In the end, she was his bright future, making up for his terrible past. The love! Oh my goodness, the love! Amar, beso, liebe, pyarr!Whatever you want to call it, they definitely have it! The chemistry, the tension, the tingling-sensations! They might try to deny it, but everyone knows, the readers, the Daniels, the Gambles, absolutely everyone, knows these two were born for each other. Let me tell you this, Miss Armentrout sure knows how to make an impression. She had me gasping, and whimpering, and screaming, and melting all in one read of this book.How in the universe does she do it? That's for her to know, and for readers to try figuring out. BY READING HER BOOKS, PEOPLE, SERIOUSLY, GO GET A COPY! Quotes I loved:\u201cGod, there needed to be an anti-sex pill or something for when she was around him.\u201d \u201c...his gaze met hers. It was crazy. Dressed down in worn blue jeans and a black shirt, he was the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever seen.And the moment was sort of perfect.Even with the deer head staring over his shoulder like a total creeper.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked before, Maddie.\u201dHer mouth dropped open. \u201cYou have not seen me completely naked, thank you very much.\u201dHis eyes glittered. \u201cActually, once before I have, when you were like five. You ran through the house buck-ass naked when you had chicken pox.\u201d\u201cOh, dear God, why do you remember these things?\u201d She was going to drown herself, right here in the tub.\u201d P.S.-I just wish this book was longer. Only 172 pages of J.Lynn goodiness doesn't cut it for me. I need at least a bajillion trillion million pages a day.

You've always been my world, ever since I can remember.\"When I heard about this book only this morning I instantly needed to download it for my Kindle and read it. For those of you who don't know J. Lynn is a pseudonym for Jennifer L Armentrout. Now you see why I had to read it? Tempting the Best Man is an adult contemporary romance that completely and utterly blew me away.Madison has always had feelings for her brother's best friend Chase. Even though he has been as ass to her again and again she still can't stop loving him. But after one night years ago now they can't stop fighting. When they are forced together as the Maid of Honor and Best Man at her brother's wedding sparks are bound to fly. But is Chase really the ass that he had acted like in the past? And can Madison really fight her feelings for Chase?I absolutely adored this book and man is it hot! As soon as I heard of this I instantly had to get it ad read it straight away. I have read so many contemporary romance books and let me say this is one of my all time favourites. As part of Entangled's Indulgence collection I wanted to read it and is the fourth of the Entangled Indulgence books that I have read. The other three were good. This was amazing!I have come to the conclusion that Jennifer can write anything, ANYTHING, and I will just adore it. I read this in one sitting I could not put it down. If you loved Jennifer's Covenant and Lux series go buy this. If you think she is an incredible paranormal writer well she's an incredibly awesome Contemporary Romance writer as well and I was completely hooked into this story from the first chapter. I couldn't put it down and when I was supposed to be studying instead I just kept reading.The characters in this book are just incredible. I loved them. Maddie is amazing. I love her. She is hilarious and had me laughing so much. Especially when she was drunk. It was hilarious! I love how strong yet emotionally vulnerable she was. I thought it was an incredible mix for a character. Chase, oh, Chase. Can Jennifer ever write a character who you don't completely 100% fall head over heels in love with? NO! It's not going to happen. I really love Chase and I loved how cocky he was but then we saw the softer side to him as well.The best parts about our two main characters is their explosive relationship. You can really feel that deep down they both love each other but they both have such powerful personalities that the sparks fly and it definitely feels like a love/hate relationship.Usually I am not a huge fan of third person perspectives but I really loved it in this book. I thought it really worked as you still got to see inside the heads of both Maddie and Chase. I loved that you got to see the perspectives of both characters and I feel like it made me love that characters more. If we didn't get to see inside of Chase's head I don't think I would love his as much as we didn't.Overall this is an amazing Contemporary Romance and I loved every single moment of it. It just confirmed that Jennifer is the best author and she couldn't write one thing that I wouldn't love. I don't even need to know what her books are about just that she wrote them is enough for me to read them. If you love Contemporary Romance books then this is a must-read. It's a very hot book with lots of tension between the characters. I loved it and I'll definitely be re-reading.\"There is no one else - there's never been anyone else for me but you.\""}, {"userName": "bookspumpkin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22418818-bookspumpkin", "userReview": "Inhalt: Schon immer ist Madison Daniels in den besten Freund ihres gro\u00dfen Bruders verliebt. Alle denken, dass sie und Chase Gamble das perfekte Paar seien, doch Madison wei\u00df es besser: Erstens sind Beziehungen ein rotes Tuch f\u00fcr Chase und zweitens fliegen zwischen ihnen nur noch die Fetzen, seit sie in einer verh\u00e4ngnisvollen Nacht vor vielen Jahren die Grenze zwischen Freundschaft und Sex \u00fcberschritten haben. Doch als die Hochzeit von Madisons Bruder ansteht, beschlie\u00dfen sie, ihm zuliebe das Kriegsbeil wenigstens f\u00fcr ein paar Tage zu begraben und das gl\u00fcckliche Paar zu geben, das alle in ihnen sehen - bis sie erfahren, dass das Hotel v\u00f6llig ausgebucht ist und sie sich eine romantische Hochzeitssuite teilen m\u00fcssen. Meine Meinung: Auf die neue Reihe von J. Lynn war ich sehr gespannt, denn sie ist einfach meine Lieblingsautorin und das wird sich wahrscheinlich auch niemals \u00e4ndern. Dementsprechend hatte ich hohe Erwartungen an das Buch, wusste aber vorher schon, dass es mir h\u00f6chstwahrscheinlich gut gefallen wird. Ich muss sagen, dass sich das Buch sehr schnell lesen lie\u00df. Der Schreibstil ist typisch f\u00fcr J. Lynn. Die Gef\u00fchle sind sehr gut herausgearbeitet und gut nachvollziehbar. Es gibt f\u00fcr mich nichts am Schreibstil auszusetzen. Die Charaktere haben mir gut gefallen. Madison ist mir sehr sympathisch gewesen und ich konnte ihre Gef\u00fchle im Laufe des Buches gut nachvollziehen. Chase ist nat\u00fcrlich - wie immer in J. Lynns B\u00fcchern - der sexy, sympathische Mann, den man selbst nicht von der Bettkante sto\u00dfen w\u00fcrde. Auch ihn konnte ich gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils in seinem Verhalten nachvollziehen. Jedoch leider nicht immer.Auf mich wirkte seine Vergangenheit und auch die Vergangenheit von Madison, die Hintergr\u00fcnde zu den Beiden Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten, zu kurz ausgearbeitet. Ich h\u00e4tte gerne mehr \u00fcber die Zwei erfahren, damit ich die Beziehung der Zwei besser h\u00e4tte verstehen k\u00f6nnen. Mir ging das alles dann doch ein bisschen zu schnell und das Buch war mir ein wenig zu kurz. Trotzdem kann ich J. Lynn nur eine gute Bewertung f\u00fcr dieses Buch geben, da es mich gut unterhalten hat und sie mit ihrem Schreibstil \u00fcberzeugen konnte. Das Buch bekommt von mir 4 von 5 Sternen und ich freue mich schon sehr auf die n\u00e4chsten zwei B\u00e4nde und bin gespannt, wie es mit Chase' Br\u00fcdern weitergeht."}, {"userName": "Viri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31499137-viri", "userReview": "***3.5***Me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho la historia de Chase, la verdad solo le\u00ed este libro porque mor\u00eda por leer el segundo de esta serie haha tengo algo por los protas que son deportistas y los romances falsos, pero para leer ese ten\u00eda que leer este primero as\u00ed que no iba con ninguna expectativa.

Maddie had ended up being maid of honor and of all people to have to stand up at the wedding with, it was Chase who was the best man. Maddie didn't know how she was going to make through the long weekend having to be around Chase with they type of feelings that she had, thinking that he didn't feel the same way. Both Maddie's family and Chases' family could see the connection that they had even from long ago and it was fun to read how they teased them about their feelings, as the families could see the connection that they had and how they tried to encourage them to act on that. I loved the different personalities of the other characters in the book. Every one so unique in their own way and how they just all fit in. Maggie and Chase get \"stuck\" in a few situations (which seemed like some well placed accidents by their family members) which makes them start to see the true connection that they do have, although not without misreading each others, actions and words along the way. You get to read the POV from both Maggie and Chase. I do wish the book would of been longer, but I did like it.

Ich kann mir diesen Aussetzer nur damit erkl\u00e4ren, dass es im Original 2012 erschienen und somit fast f\u00fcnf Jahre alt ist und damit zu ihren Erstlingen geh\u00f6rt. Was zeigt, jeder f\u00e4ngt mal klein an.Aber nun zu diesem Buch. Es h\u00e4tte mir unglaublich gut gefallen k\u00f6nnen, immerhin schreibt Armentrout hier \u00fcber erwachsene Liebe.

Kaum hat man angefangen, ist man auch schon wieder durch. Ich habe keinen Tag f\u00fcr das Buch gebraucht, und das nicht, weil es so mega spannend war, sondern mit den knapp 200 Seiten, extrem kurz und wie gesagt oberfl\u00e4chlich und schnell abgehandelt.Wie die Handlung, sind mir auch die Charaktere viel zu kurz gekommen, ohne Tiefe, nur ebenfalls oberfl\u00e4chlich angeschnitten, weshalb ich nicht richtig mitf\u00fchlen konnte.

I don't understand why Armentrout didn't make the effort to write a full length novel for this story. I thought the plot was fantastic and had the potential to be a 300+ page book, instead of the novella length that it was. I spent most of the time I was reading wondering why she couldn't have expanded on the scenes and topics that she only lightly brushed over, it at least could have been as long as the third book in the series. I really like the 'she's in love since childhood, but he won't touch her because she's his best friend's baby sister' trope, so add another 100 pages to flesh out the characters and make the instalust/love slightly less insta and this could have been five stars.

Their easy friendship was destroyed the night they made out and then Chase walked away without a backward glance and now, on the rare occasions when Madison isn't able to avoid him, they find themselves constantly bickering. Chase always cherished his friendship with Madison but after watching his father's constant cheating destroy his mother he's determined to avoid relationships himself. When a family wedding forces the two of them into close proximity it's very hard to resist the heat that builds between them but Chase hasn't changed his mind about relationships and Madison is determined not to get her heart broken all over again.I tend to have high expectations to Jennifer L. Armentrout / J. Lynn's contemporary romances and I love the older brother's best friend trope so I was looking forward to reading Tempting the Best Man and I hate to admit it wasn't quite as good as I had hoped it would be. It's not a bad read by any means but it's definitely not one of her best. The story is quite predictable, that isn't something that bothers me on it's own - after all most contemporary romance is predictable to a certain extent - but coupled with the completely forced and unnecessary drama towards the end it just irritated the heck out of me.For the most part I liked both Madison and Chase, they have great chemistry and I enjoyed the heat between them. I loved the interactions with Madison's family and Chase's brothers, that family dynamic always adds a little extra to the story and it was amusing watching them meddle in the budding relationship. Everyone else could see how Madison and Chase felt about each other and they were determined to push the two of them together. There was a lot of humour in the story and it was a great light hearted read but I could have done without the contrived drama towards the end of the story. It definitely lost a star for the last few chapters, especially since there was a huge amount of drama and stress and then it was all resolved within a couple of pages. I liked Chase's brothers enough to want to read their stories though and I'm definitely hoping that the series will only get better from here."}], "description": "Madison Daniels has worshiped her brother's best friend since they were kids.
