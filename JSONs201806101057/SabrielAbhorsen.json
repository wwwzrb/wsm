Fuck me, can we turn around and go back to the library?\" I asked my husband.He shook his head and smiled at me. \"Just try it. You never know.\"\"It's for twelve-to-thirteen year olds! No sex! No swearing! Minimum violence! I don't fucking think so!\"In the end, we brought it home and I sulked the whole way. However yesterday I opened it up and thought I'd actually give it a try and I'm really glad it did.It actually managed to have more romance in it than Darkfever did, and that bloody book has NAKED people on the front cover, for crying out loud!I thought this was going to be a story about a young girl on a magical adventure with a sword and a bad hair-do. But it turns out it's about an eighteen year old woman with dark, deadly skills being chased and hunted by a terrible and deadly enemy.Sabriel has a good, clear head on her shoulder. She's smart, she's strong, she's a well-balanced and interesting character. The characters in Sabriel are all interesting and capturing in their way. Mogget was just pure win. He cracked me up. Touchstone was annoying at first but quickly won me over.The world is interesting and complex, filled with enough creepy things that go bump in the night to really freak me out.That's the best thing about this book. It's not TRYING to be a children's book. The rising action, climax and VERY short denouement had me on the edge of my seat. I was actually on the edge of my seat throughout most of the book.In some parts it's really freaky and quite scary, in other parts it's sad.This is the second male author I've come across lately that has written female characters BETTER than the women have been writing them lately. You can't even compare Sabriel to a character like Bella. Unless you were to really dumb it down into this: Bella - sucks, Sabriel - awesome beyond all belief.Give this book a go. It was fun, scary, action packed and I absolutely can't wait to read the sequels!"}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "3.5"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Re/read on audio.

And those that will not rest, I bind-or try to. I am Abhorsen . . .\"He looked at the baby again, and added, almost with a note of surprise, \"Father of Sabriel.\"\nOh, what a wonderful little book. I loved Sabriel so much. She was so tough and just got things done. She received a message from her father and she knew things were not right. She wasn't sure if he was dying or what was happening at first. She received his sword and other things through a messenger. She was to be the next Abhorsen of sorts. This message takes Sabriel on a journey to find her father and find and kill the evil that is happening across the land. It's a bit creepy at parts which is good =) She has a sidekick named Mogget that she picks up at her fathers house. He's a cat and he talks and he is really something different. And he is also bound from being free. Then they pick up one more person that Mogget names Touchstone and he was a guard to the Queen. There's a big story there but you can read it yourself. They go on a journey to get away from the evil that is trying to kill Sabriel while trying to set things right. Sabriel has powers herself but she can only do so much. The end of the story was pretty amaze balls. I look forward to the rest of the books =)Happy Reading!

TIM CURRY did a \nfabulous and amazing\n job narrating this fantasy. I suppose it's \"young adult,\" even though the book really begins with the main character being 18. Sabriel went to an all-girl school for magic. The story picks up near the end of her education. She leaves because a messenger from her father sends her his bells and sword and she realizes he is in trouble.Most of the story is about Sabriel's journey to save her father and escape Dead creatures and the evil free magic being called Kerrigor. Kerrigor doesn't want to stay dead and is going to destroy the world trying to reclaim Life. Sabriel is a necromancer, her father the greatest necromancer alive, called the Abhorsen. This is a bit \"grimdark lite.\" There is violence, but not too many gruesome details.Sabriel picks up a couple sidekicks. One is another free magic creature called Mogget. As long as Mogget is bound by his collar, he looks and acts like a sarcastic small white cat. When his collar comes off, watch out! All bets are off.Sabriel also meets a Royal Guard named Touchstone who accompanies her on her quest. He ends up becoming a romantic interest, but it's very romance-light and nothing sappy or angsty. I quite liked both Mogget and Touchstone! Sabriel was a good positive female character. Sometimes the pacing dragged, but there were some exciting scenes as well - and GREAT world building. I plan to continue listening to the series, as Tim Curry narrates them all and my library has them all too! :)"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "[(A MAGIC PRINCE yay) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Charlotte May", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14002983-charlotte-may", "userReview": "\u201cThen Sabriel hears it - the massed grinding of Dead joints, no longer joined by gristle; the padding of Dead feet, bones like hobtails clicking through necrotic flesh.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll admit a book involving the dead (or zombies if you will) wouldn\u2019t be a normal pick for me. Despite this, Sabriel kept my attention and there was plenty of magic and world building to hook me in!Sabriel\u2019s father is the Abhorsen - a necromancer with a difference! He returns the dead to their resting place, sends creatures that should be dead into death and generally protects the living from the dead!When her father goes missing Sabriel must leave her boarding school, travel over the wall into the Old Kingdom and face all sorts of enemies (mainly dead or half dead or bodies taken over by dead spirits- you get the idea.) With delightful descriptions such as this: \u201clike an apple corer punching the Dead spirit out of the rotting corpse.\u201d The main magic system is that of Charter Magic - the use of symbols to create spells, and anyone who is a Charter Mage will have a symbol on their forehead to indicate this. It was a fantastic and creative system. The other characters were great - Mogget the talking yet mysterious cat and Touchstone - the poor chap who has been trapped for 200 years and has just been rescued. I really enjoyed this, it was a quick read and though parts of the magic system were a bit tough to figure out I thought it was a great concept and I\u2019ve never read anything else like it! \u201cLet this be my final lesson.

In recent years, I met so many people who cherish this series that I just knew I had to reread the first book, and I\u2019m so glad that I did. While this wasn\u2019t a perfect read for me by any means, it set the stage for what I genuinely believe is going to be an incredible series.\n\u201cDoes the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?\u201d\n\u2192 necromancy \u2190I\u2019m such a sucker for necromancy books in general, and the way the world of the Dead and the Abhorsens is created in this book is wonderful, but not as fleshed out as I hoped it would be. I adored every single sentence about the world of the Dead, the bells, the magic, and the ways in which Abhorsens (Sabriel\u2019s family of necromancers) interact with all of the above, but it was never quite enough. Had I gotten an extra 50-100 pages of pure, unadulterated world-building, I believe this would have been a 4-star read for me, if not better.That said, the setup we do get is magnificent: the act of necromancy is portrayed in such a fascinating and risky way, and the Dead themselves are downright creepy. These aren\u2019t wispy ghosts and quiet whispers in shadowy halls; these are looming, vicious creatures, on a mission to regain their status among the living, no matter the cost.\nDeath and what came after death was no great mystery to Sabriel. She just wished it was.\n\u2192 Sabriel \u2190The second double-edged sword in this book was Sabriel\u2019s character, who I wanted so badly to love \u2013 and I did love, by the end \u2013 but I had such a hard time connecting to her! She feels very ingenuine for the first 2/3 or so of the book. Any time she feels a particularly strong emotion, it\u2019s described to us, but in a way that feels too clinical and detached to relate to. I think this was definitely just a sign of inexperienced writing, because even by the end of the book, I was able to connect with her more solidly, and I hear that this particular writing issue is one that is resolved in the other books in this series.Even without feeling like Sabriel is a three-dimensional, complex character, I still soundly enjoyed who she had the potential to be. She\u2019s tough, intelligent, and warm, without an evil bone in her body. I think the biggest reason her lack of development frustrated me was simply because, with better writing, I could have seen Sabriel becoming one of my absolute favorite heroines (and, in fact, I do remember adoring her as a child).\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u2192 romance \u2190Finally, the reason I just could not bring myself to give this book a higher rating: insta-love. Funny enough, it was more of an issue with the love interest than it was with Sabriel (which, at the very least, was a refreshing change from the trope of the female in an f/m relationship being the first to fall). I won\u2019t give any spoilers, but I will say that the quote I used at the heading of this section actually made me laugh out loud and roll my eyes a little bit. It\u2019s not just that these two characters spend so little time together before confessing their love; it\u2019s also a matter of the fact that they barely speak to one another throughout the entire book, as most of their limited time together is a tumultuous, stressful, and fairly quiet journey.On the other hand, a fellow blogger recently gave me some interesting food for thought: insta-love can be used as a plot device, to depict how na\u00efve the characters are, and that could easily be said for the pairing in Sabriel. If that was the author\u2019s intentions, I can respect it, but I still don\u2019t feel like it was the best route; in fact, I think my preference would\u2019ve been for this book to be entire romance-free.\n\u201cYou are the fifty-third Abhorsen, Sabriel. I have not taught you as well as I should \u2013 let this be my final lesson. Everyone and everything has a time to die.\u201d\n\u2192 final thoughts \u2190All in all, this book has a lot of flaws, but it\u2019s got so much potential and such an interesting and unique storyline that I would ask you not to let this 3-star rating convince you for a moment that I didn\u2019t enjoy it. On the contrary, I had a wonderful time rereading Sabriel, and I\u2019ve already ordered myself a new copy of the second book so that I can see what else Garth Nix has in store for the series.You can find this review and more on my blog, or you can follow me on twitter, bookstagram, or facebook!---First buddy read with Terry, my love!"}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "I shall write a wee bit about my thoughts on this book as I read, for I do not trust my foggy brain to keep up with them if I wait until the last minute.*I like the juxtaposition of 20th Century (early) Ancelstierre with a medieval-esque world of the Old Kingdom. It threw me for a loop at first, how the prologue was very medieval (pre-Industrial), and the first chapter was modernesque. I was thinking, are they immortal or something? But further reading clears that up.*I don't read as much pure fantasy (which I am working on changing), but this magic system stands out to me. The Charter concept. The magic system is based on sketching out these symbols that have a magical power behind them. They can also be whistled or sung, if bells are not available. *There are some geniuinely creepy elements that make this story borderline horrific, if not dark fantasy in tone. There were moments that held me breathless, my stomach tight with dread. I like the manner in which Nix incorporates zombies. Zombies are not a favorite horror element of mine. But this type of zombie is scary, because the emphasis is on the dark spiritual (if you will) aspects. The ability of dark Charter mages to command spirits to come back from the realms of the Dead, binding them in service. Dark stuff. The loss of free will is a big sticking point with me. Nix succeeds in unnerving me in a deeper way, and doesn't focus on the gory, squeamish aspects of zombies that repel rather than cause the fear response.*The author's ability to describe and propel the narrative without being too dense. I like a more natural, simplistic form of prose when I'm reading. That is what has kept me from starting some of the magic fantasy sagas, thus far.*The welcome elements of subtle humor. Mogget is a spirit in the form of a cat. He could not be more feline in personality. I love this scene:Mogget had no time for such introspection, mourning or pangs of responsibility. He left her watching, blank-eyed, for no more than minute, before padding forward and delicately inserting his claws in Sabriel's slippered foot..That's exactly what one of my cats would do to get my attention. Haha.So far, I'm enjoying this read. I didn't even turn on my computer and get on Goodreads last night. I just read my book. And I turned off the tv to better concentrate.That's it for now...Update: 4/25/10Okay, I finished this book after 1am this morning. I loved it. It was intense, it was moving, it was written in a manner that allowed the story to flow, but with a richness of detail that made it visually stunning as I read. The magic was fascinating. Intricate, but written so that the reader doesn't feel clueless.I absolutely loved Sabriel. She's a strong girl. She went through such a harrowing experience. I mean, there are some truly dark moments in this story. Her father must have been so proud of her. I know I was. Although the book doesn't really show Sabriel with her father, (the present Abhorsen (a person who sends the restless dead back where they belong), all that much, I loved the relationship between the two. A rich father-daughter relationship always appeals in a story, and I think readers of a similar mind will enjoy this part of the book.For many years, I didn't read fantasy. I am sad about that, and resolved to make up for lost time. Urban fantasy and paranormal romance rekindled my childhood love of this genre. This book has truly lit me on fire to read more fantasy. I was drawn to the heroism, but also the ambiguity of this world, where the power of magic has the power to corrupt those who are not strong of mind and spirit. I'm drawn to a story where the heroine is on a journey that tests her spirit, and she comes out of it a stronger, wiser person. Sabriel definitely fits the bill for that kind of story.Although Sabriel is the major focus of this story, I felt that Mogget and Touchstone were strong characters that added to the texture of this story. The light romantic elements between Sabriel and Touchstone were more than welcome.Sabriel was a vivid, captivating, often scary introduction to the Abhorsen series, and my first read by Garth Nix. It will not be my last."}, {"userName": "Heather Turner", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47996-heather-turner", "userReview": "Possibly one of the greatest fantasy adventures of our times, Garth Nix's first novel is a lush, magical, dark-witty adventure about a young woman's battle with the hideous Dead.The story starts with a flashback in which a special necromancer named Abhorsen saves his baby daughter Sabriel from a creature called Kerrigor, in the spiritual river of death. Many years later, at an English-esque boarding school, Sabriel must take up her father's magical sword and bells and try to find out what has happened to him. To do so, she must leave her relatively high-tech home for the Old Kingdom, where magic rules and evil things are stalking her.Along the way, she is accompanied by the guard Touchstone and the menacing/funny cat-spirit Mogget. They must try to defeat the evil Kerrigor, who wants to blast the Charter which keeps all things from descending into evil.Sabriel is the best fantasy hero I've read about since Lord of the Rings. Too many fantasy heroines are either damsels or warrior women--Sabriel is neither. She acts and thinks precisely like a young woman in her position. Strong, intriguing, and no slack with a sword in a bad situation, she is a wonderful role model.Touchstone is a darling, but Mogget really is unique. Is he evil? Good? Or some peculiar mix? This ancient spirit forced to live as a cat is enslaved to the Abhorsen family for the good of everyone (we get a glimpse of how dangerous he is). The world that Garth Nix dreamed up, a mixture of Tolkien and WW2 England, is unparalleled in the fantasy genre. It's populated by animated ghouls, ghastly Mordicants, the almost-human sendings, Charter ghosts, the inhabitants of the river of Death, where only Abhorsens go, and so on...His writing style is lush and hypnotic--you can actually see the events unfolding in front of your eyes, in this wintry but inviting world."}, {"userName": "Merna ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16392157-merna", "userReview": "\u201cLet this be my final lesson. Everyone and everything has a time to die.\u201d\nI really wish I had liked Sabriel more than I actually did. It had a decent idea, however, as I kept reading I continuously kept thinking about events in my life or my plans for the next day. My mind kept drifting off because I was purely so bored. I believe merely saying a book is boring isn\u2019t a convincing or a valid reason to conclude that the book wasn\u2019t good. Have you ever read a book where endless things are happening after another, but you feel as if barely anything is occurring, because the action is always so similar to the previous ones that ensued in the book and it feels overused? The plot essentially went like this:Something bad happensSabriel defeats itSomething bad happensSabriel escapesSomething bad happensSabriel escapesSomething bad happensSabriel Defeats itAnyway, I thought the concept for the story was intriguing at first.The story is set in two fictional countries. To the south lies Ancelstierre where technology and society is comparable to the 20th century England, and to the north lies the Old Kingdom where magic and spirits wander the land. In the Old Kingdom there is always a sorcerer with the title Abhorsen who puts the dead (spirits) to rest. The dead are raised by Necromancers or black magicians, who roam the Old Kingdom. Basically an Abhorsen is a Necromancer themselves, only they do the opposite. Sabriel is an Abhorsen who lives in Ancelstierre and her dad lives in the Old Kingdom. She sets on a journey to the Old Kingdom after her father\u2019s sudden disappearance. However, quarter way through the book:Sabriel was a likable female character, so I have to give the male author some applause for writing believable female character. On the other hand, I felt no connection with Sabriel since her emotions where rarely expressed, instead there was a massive amount of description about many other things that caused me to yawn endlessly. Her love interest is - well, not interesting. He was flat and dull. I feel as if I\u2019m betraying the fantasy genre for not liking this as much as I probably should. I feel an obligation to like fantasy books that have original concepts, considering fantasy is one of my favourite genres. Oh well, I still praise the idea of the story very much and I think that solely earns 3 stars, but I didn't find it to be an entertaining or engaging read for it to earn anymore than that."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Sabriel (Abhorsen #1), Garth NixFirst published in 1995. It is the first in his Abhorsen (Old Kingdom) series, followed by Lirael, Abhorsen, and Goldenhand. The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: To the South lies Ancelstierre, which has a technology level and society similar to that of early-20th century Australia, and to the North lies the Old Kingdom, where both Free magic and Charter Magic exist \u2014 a fact officially denied by the government of Ancelstierre and disbelieved by most of Ancelstierre's inhabitants.

Since the fall of the Royal Family, dangerous entities roam, ranging from the undead to powerful sorcerers and Free Magic elementals.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2006 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0644 - \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06af\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u0627 (\u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u062a\u062c\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0648\u0631)\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u06af\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u060c 1383\u060c \u062f\u0631 291 \u0635\u060c \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9648662002\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0641\u0642\u060c 1391\u060c \u062f\u0631 580 \u0635\u060c \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643698218\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u060c 1393\u060c \u062f\u0631 580 \u0635\u060c \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789645369734\u061b\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\u0646\u060c \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u06af\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0633 \u0631\u0627 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0645. \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0631 \u06a9\u0634\u0634 \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f. \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u060c \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u062f\u0648\u06cc \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0647 \u0627\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0634 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u062f\u0634\u0645\u0646\u06cc \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648 \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645\u0634 \u062a\u0647\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0627\u06cc\u0645\u0632: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0648 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0628\u060c \u0635\u062d\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u0648 \u0647\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0644\u0630\u062a \u0645\u062d\u0636 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0644. \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Catriona (LittleBookOwl)", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365999-catriona-littlebookowl", "userReview": "4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Judith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/433328-judith", "userReview": "When an otherworldly visitor tells Sabriel that her father has been trapped in the world of the dead, she has no choice but to leave her student's life in Ancelstierre and venture into the Old Kingdom to save him. There, in her father's absence, she must take up the mantle of Abhorsen, a necromancer charged with making sure that the dead stay dead. Although she does not believe herself to be up to the task, Sabriel must make the journey, with only a mysterious talking cat named Mogget, and a re-awakened amnesiac guardsman, Touchstone, by her side.Garth Nix is easily my favorite YA fantasy author of the moment, and one of my favorite authors full stop. Sabriel made him popular and respected among fans of the genre, and I can see why.It's a brilliant, fast-paced book that is quite impossible to put down. This means a lot coming from someone like me, with an average attention span of 20 pages or less. It has a solid plot, realistic characters, and a unique world built so seamlessly, it's entirely believable.Garth Nix is a good world builder in that he lays down the foundation of a brand-new world and lets the \"fantastic\" details seep through not by long-winded info-dumps but by winding them so neatly through the narrative that you hardly notice what he's doing. The world and magic of the Old Kingdom is unlike many magic systems I've come across, and it's great how he never once spends more than two pages to explain things away. Of course, this means that a number of things are left unexplored but I suppose since there are two more books in the series, there's still time to explore them there.His characters are also some of the most human I have ever come across. Sabriel and Touchstone are competent as heroine and hero, but are flawed enough to be interesting without ever falling into the \"emo\" or whiny and melodramatic pits that adolescent characters are wont to do in this genre. For all the strangeness of the world they live in, the characters are as real as can be, and the relationship between Sabriel and Touchstone develops with taste and subtlety. Most admirable is how Sabriel is portrayed as a normal girl with normal concerns rather than either a weeping, confused damsel or an overly masculinized (is that a word?) warrior woman. Also, she doesn't dissolve into a spineless, sex-obsessed sap when presented with a boy, despite clearly having the usual anxieties and feelings in that regard. She proves to be a quick-witted heroine, and Garth Nix doesn't cheapen her character and throws her into some really awesome, breathtaking conflicts.As a last note, although this is the first book of a trilogy, it's a solid story all on its own so you can pick it up with no worries as to whether you should complete the series or not."}, {"userName": "TS Chan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan", "userReview": "Sabriel is a captivating and original tale of destiny.Does the walker choose the path, or the path the walker?I picked up this book because Brandon Sanderson recommended it in his review for Goldenhand, the 5th book in the Abhorsen series. He termed this as \"one of the fundamental experiences that helped me shape my philosophy on magic systems and worldbuilding.\" With such an endorsement from my favourite author of all time, I cannot possibly pass over this book. And I am glad that I didn't. As a novel categorised as young adult fantasy, Sabriel is a well-crafted tale with all the necessary elements which make fantasy so enjoyable, be it for the intended target audience or more mature readers. First of all, the Prologue hooked me right from the start. It quickly establishes the notion that the titular character, Sabriel, is going to be someone special together with a glimpse of this world's magic. The narrative then jumps ahead eighteen years where Sabriel was now in the final semester of her college studies when she discovered that her father, the Abhorsen, is in mortal danger and decided immediately to head into the Old Kingdom to rescue him.Now, let's appreciate the worldbuilding a bit. The Old Kingdom is separated from the modern world by a Wall, which keeps the Dead who wouldn't stay dead away from Ancelstierre. And if you now start to think, \"Hey wait a minute, isn't that similar to ASOIAF\", I would like to point out that Sabriel was published a year before Game of Thrones. The modern world, Ancelstierre, is akin to our early twentieth century where there is electricity, motor vehicles and tanks, guns and ammunition. And the magic of the Old Kingdom - both in the form of Free Magic and the Charter - gets weaker the farther away one is from the Wall which demarcates the boundary between both lands. What is unusual is how the Old Kingdom appears as a completely different world. Step through the gate in the Wall, and one experiences a time and reality warp of sorts, where for one moment one is in sunny and warm Ancelstierre and then the next, in a cold and wintry landscape. Even the stars are several degrees off in the night sky, and time passes asynchronously to Ancelstierre. Its name, the Old Kingdom, also alludes to the fact that with the existence of magic, modern technology had not taken hold in this land as it did just over the Wall. I won't go into much detail and hence spoil the fun but I will mention that the two magic systems - Free Magic and the Charter - are somewhat anathema to each other. The exposition of these two branches of magic is deftly woven into the storytelling, which avoided the dreaded info-dump. There is an aspect of music in the magic of necromancy (i.e. bells) and the Charter that I found most intriguing and, for lack of a better word, cool.Great worldbuilding and cool magic systems alone do not make a great fantasy book. Characters are the mortar to the bricks of good, solid storytelling. Sabriel is a great protagonist who acts her age, has her doubts, is not infallible and just feels authentic. In other words, she is not perfect, and the author does not try to make her so. Although she is quite special in her own right, the narrative does not focus on trying to hammer that fact into the reader's brains. SabrielWithout having much knowledge and experience required to survive the Old Kingdom in her quest to rescue her father, she has to rely on the assistance of an aloof cat, Mogget, and a young Charter Mage, Touchstone. There is always something about animal characters, whether they are capable of speech or not and this one does, that elevates the reading experience for me. In short, Mogget is superb. If I have to pick an issue with this novel, it is the romance which felt like it came out of nowhere. Fortunately, this only appeared in small doses closer towards the end, where the book concluded most satisfactorily with an exciting page-turning climax. For a fantasy book written before the new millennium, I take the view that it reads just as well if not better than some of its present peers - YA or otherwise. I look forward to continuing with the Abhorsen series and will recommend this to fantasy readers who are looking for well-written young female protagonists.

If more YA was written like this, I'd read more of it. Of course, I should point out that this book was published in 1995, well before the genre was Twilighted and, as such, there were no uber emo teenagers angsting over their melodramatic love triangles. And thank the universe for that! Instead we get a sensible and somewhat awkward young heroine who is afraid of the dark currents swirling around her, anxious about her abilities to meet the oncoming challenges, yet nevertheless determined to deal with any obstacles as they come. Along the way she finds help and opposition in equal measure but the focus always remains on her journey. She is young and inexperienced but she's smart enough to ask questions and to accept help when it is honestly offered - no obnoxious false bravado from this young lady.\"Fear and realization of ignorance were strong medicines against stupid pride.\"The story was a little slow to get moving but the writing style felt so smooth and comfortable that I didn't mind. The magic system was intriguing, as was the whole matter of dealing with the Dead, and the description of the Nine Gates painted quite a picture. It also presents a reality where a more traditional fantasy land, known as the Old Kingdom, shares a border with a more modern world - complete with cars - known as Ancelstierre. I still have some questions about how that whole situation evolved and I hope that the answers will come in the rest of the trilogy. And speaking of that, now that I know that these books are narrated by Tim Curry, I plan to finish out the trilogy in audiobook format. P.S.

But, once you go through those first mind numbing 100 pages, this book is actually pretty decent.The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: The Old Kingdom to the north, where magic works and dangerous spirits roam the land and the :Ancelstierre, to the south, the \u201cmuggle land\u201d with people blissfully ignorant except for those few who live near the border between the kingdoms. The dead refuse to stay dead, and are often raised by evil Necromancers to do their evil bidding. Here the Abhorsens comes to the rescue and puts the dead to rest. Sabriel, our protagonist, is placed with this huge responsibility of being an Abhorsen, when suddenly her father goes missing, thus, likes all fantasy heroes and heroines, she is placed with the duty of saving the world and rescuing her father. Need I mention that great adventure, life threatening dangers, amusing characters and a little romance greet her on this epic journey? In some aspects, Sabriel definitely follows all the fantasy clich\u00e9s. Yet, with a powerful plot, decent writing, loveable characters and good pacing (again, not for the first 100 pages!), I cannot bring myself to complain. The world building is amazing, with a lot of care given to minute details. The ingenious concept of death by passing through the seven gates, Saraneth and the bells, Clayrs and free magic soon made me forget about the agony of the slow start, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the book.So, 4 stars for the book, although I don\u2019t reckon I would read the next part basically because, there is going to be a different set of characters, and I can\u2019t imagine this series without Mogget.I did mention the talking cat, right?MOGGET, BEST CHARACTER EVER!"}, {"userName": "Sanaa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944522-sanaa", "userReview": "[4.5 Stars] Sabriel is such a wonderful story, really. I absolutely adored it! The only criticism I really have is that the magic was at times confusing and there isn't much character development. That being said, I could really ignore most of that because Sabriel was so fabulous and the magic was so cool and Mogget was so great. I'm not really sure what else to say. This book surprised me. I didn't expect to love it as much as I did, but here I am absolutely loving it. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!"}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/211278-simon", "userReview": "UPDATED BELOW. I started this and wanted to give up in frustration about one fifth of the way in. But the book gets an awful lot of love from many well-respected friends on GR and I'm tempted to give it another go. My problem was mostly with the quality of the writing, which I found awful, to be frank. There are various things that just seem wrong, although one can make out the intended sense. And there is much more that just seems heavy and clunky: odd word choices, labored explanations of the characters' thoughts, motivations, and behavior, and so on. I'd be interested to know if the book's fans here like it despite the writing, or if they differ from me in their opinion of the writing's merit. Anyway, I may come back to this when I finish \"Wolf Hall,\" which I took up instead.-------------------Added on 6/5 after finishing the book:I ended up liking the book a bit more than at the start, but not liking it greatly. I'm still somewhat mystified by the props it gets from many of my friends here on GR. As I mentioned above, I found the writing clumsy. For example, Sabriel, the heroine, refers to her father as \"Dad\" just once in the whole book, I think. The tone of the familiar \"Dad\", totally unprepared and arriving at a particularly solemn moment, was like a fart in church. Another example: \u201cKerrigor laughed again, an obscene cackle that rose to a manic crescendo, before suddenly cutting to an ominous silence\u201d. The series of three adjective-noun pairs makes one feel that there\u2019s an adjective or two too many. And the particular adjectives seem hackneyed with their respective nouns (especially the use of \u201cobscene\u201d with \u201ccackle\u201d). Also, a crescendo is a process, not a state that terminates a process. Well, rather than go on, let me make a point about\u2026.Names. I\u2019m reading a history of the fall of the Roman empire and many of the players, Alans, Sarmatians, Huns, etc., left no written record of their culture. Nonetheless, scholars today know something of the languages these peoples spoke owing to the preservation, in Roman histories and perhaps other places, of (personal and place) names they used. The names in Sabriel seem a bit of a mess to me. First, \u201cSabriel\u201d itself, along with the names of some of the necromantic bells she wields \u2013 \u201cMosrael\u201d and \u201cAstarel\u201d \u2013 are clearly reminiscent of Hebrew angel names like \u201cMichael\u201d, \u201cRaphael\u201d and so on. But the world building of the book involves no reference to ancient Hebrew culture. The name of the land to the south of the Old Kingdom is \u201cAncelstierre\u201d, which evokes a Latin etymology that puts its meaning as something like \u201cLand of the ancestors\u201d. Again, why the Latinity here? The chief villain was called, in Life, Rogir, a slight twist on the Norman \u201cRoger\u201d; and in death, he goes by \u201cKerrigor\u201d, which is a childhood nickname, an inversion of \u201cRogirek\u201d (I don\u2019t remember whether \u201cRogirek\u201d was the full form of \u201cRogir\u201d or itself already a game). For the greatest of the Dead to go by the backwards version of his name is\u2026 well, incongruous. Finally, there is \u201cAbhorsen\u201d. This is originally presented as a proper name, of Sabriel\u2019s father. (He introduces himself thus: \u201cI am called Abhorsen\u201d.) Later, we learn it is actually a title. Someone is an, or the, Abhorsen. Thereafter, the use of the term wavers unstably between name and title. I can\u2019t settle in my mind whether this is simply carelessness on the part of the author, or whether something is meant to be made of it. The issue is dwelt on enough that it seems deliberate, but I can\u2019t figure out what its significance is. Finally, the name \u201cAbhorsen\u201d itself is very odd. (The) Abhorsen is, essentially, a good if feared and strange figure. But the word conjures up \u201cabhor\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d, both very strange resonances for the character(s) involved. (It also vaguely suggests the \u201c\u2026son\u201d suffix of Germanic names, to add to the Hebrew and Latin resonances of other names in the work.)Perhaps all this agonizing about the names is misplaced. But I found it both distracting and somehow symptomatic of the failure of world building in this novel."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Read this quite some time ago and have been meaning to get to the sequels for some time...so first I reread this one...:)This is an interesting YA novel set in a world that is split. There is Ancelstierre, the southern Kingdom which is a technological society about at the level of World War I era Earth (that would be our Earth). It seems much like the UK (as they play rugby and cricket at the boarding schools). There is no magic in Ancelstierre. As a matter of fact they (mostly) regard magic and all things magical as superstition. This is actually a problem because they share a border (in the North) with the Old Kingdom, where magic is the rule. Technology fails near the border (especially if the wind is from that direction) and unfortunately occasionally, the dead get up and attack. That is they do unless they are bound by The Abhorsen. The novel concerns Sabriel (you might have intuited that from the title). She is a young woman from the Old Kingdom who has been sent to a boarding school in the south. This is a school near the border where magic is recognized and taught, even though it is in the southern kingdom. Sabriel is waiting for a visit from her father Abhorsen, when the book opens. He doesn't show up.But a dead sending does come with a message from him. He is apparently trapped in death.Thus begins Sabriel's adventure. Very quickly she finds that her father's name isn't Abhorsen, but that he is THE Abhorsen. The Abhorsen is a sort of reverse or good necromancer who doesn't call dead things back into life from death, but lays them to rest and/or binds the ones that want to came back and feed on the living in death. Things are changing in the Old Kingdom, as a matter of fact they have been for some time, and Sabriel having been south is sadly uninformed about it all. Now she finds herself responsible for saving her father, possibly everyone in the Old Kingdom and maybe everyone else in the world as well.The book does a good job of drawing us in, explaining the world and giving us an intro into the magic system of this world. This is a YA book but don't let that put you off. There are quite a few books considered YA that transcend that definition and are simply good novels. This is one. This is an excellent fantasy.C.S.Lewis said, \"...a children's story which is only enjoyed by children is a bad children's story\". This one can be and I think will be enjoyed by all ages."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/899665-jon", "userReview": "3.75 starsSabriel attends Wyverley College, a boarding school for girls on the Ancelstierre side of the Wall. In addition to reading, writing and arithmatic, she studies Charter Magic and necromancy. Her father, the Abhorsen, usually visits from the Old Kingdom once or twice a year. He trains her in binding the Dead so they stay dead using The Book of the Dead, Charter Magic and the Bells. When her father fails to visit, Sabriel grows worried and seeks to find him across the Wall in the Old Kingdom. Almost immediately after crossing, Sabriel is best by Dead roaming and hunting the countryside near the Wall. She narrowly escapes the first attack and flees to her father's home to rest, recuperate and research. The rest of the story relates Sabriel's search for her father and discovery of the serious threats facing the Old Kingdom. The magic system consists of the Charter and a Charter Symbol for everything (apparently an almost infinite number of them). Necromancy, at least the kind practiced by the Abhorsens, deals with the binding of the dead through pure tones, usually generated by bells, and a hands-on knowledge of the topography and Gates of Death. Free Magic represents wildness and can be bound by silver and the bells as well. Sabriel seemed very mature for a teenager, but that's understandable with what she's been taught and thrust into. Touchstone, as guardian sidekick and love interest, is formulaic but comforting. The final climactic ending delivered a good punch and not much of a cliff hanger, for which I'm very grateful. If I continue this series, I will do so because I want to, not because I have to. I recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy and wants to foray down a different more supernatural path of adventure."}], "description": "Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom.
