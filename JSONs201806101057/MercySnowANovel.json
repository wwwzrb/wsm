yes. are those questions easily handled by anyone needing to hide the truth? yes. same for the Thing That Was Witnessed. it doesn't mean anything at all, not on a criminal level. socially awkward, yes, and had it come to light earlier, before nature had its way with the crime scene, maybe i could have been significant, but time has passed. it is not threatening. get better clues!oh, and the ending.... it was kind of Tess of the d'Urbervilles-y, so that was not my favorite. but there are a lot of good things about this book, even as it straddles the line between \"interesting descriptions\" and \"occasionally purple\"She never told Cal about the encounter, and over the years she forgot all about it until Pruitt's death and the subsequent arrival of his estranged children picked the skin off that wound and left it as exposed as the tattoos she sometimes glimpsed etched onto the mill worker's backs - fiery, fanged creatures posed with wild eyes and claws drawn, yet trapped forever in the pale of human flesh. but overall, i would say \"yes\" to someone looking for one of those \"family stories set in bleak america\" types of book."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Four and a half starsI became thoroughly immersed in the story of the small New Hampshire town of Titan Falls and the characters who inhabited it. A tragic bus accident that sees one young woman dead and the bus driver in a critical condition, starts rumours and suspicion flowing. These largely centre on Zeke Snow but his sister Mercy cannot believe he is responsible. The Snow family are considered losers by most of the tight knit community. Meanwhile June McAllister, wife of the paper mill owner, finds out more than she would rather know about her husband, Cal. How far is she prepared to go to protect the life she has? How far will Mercy go to try and prove Zeke\u2019s innocence? Caught like a pawn between them, is Mercy and Zeke\u2019s young sister Hannah. Other characters, like Hazel whose husband Fergus was the bus driver, are also caught in the middle of this drama played out in Titan Falls. I thought this was an interesting comment about attitudes with regard to Hazel\u2019s thoughts at one stage about Mercy, \u2019It wasn\u2019t anything the girl did really. It was more all the uncomfortable little truths she made Hazel realize about herself.\u2019 We may often feel similarly about others. Also liked this other question raised, \u2019Where did one person\u2019s influence on another ever begin or end?\u2019 Food for thought. Then there are who the healings that happen and seem to be attributable to Mercy Snow. When a skeleton is found on Snow land it only adds to the mysteries in this mill town with its river polluted because of the mill that affects most of the town\u2019s inhabitants in one way or another. I loved the writing in this novel, and the characters. They were so real. This book is about prejudices, class differences, loss, choice, secrets and one that raises thought provoking questions like how far a person will go to protect those they love or how influenced people are by the attitudes and opinions of others. I wasn\u2019t thrilled with one event that happened towards the end, only because I loved the character, but thinking about it afterwards conceded that maybe it had to be. My emotions were engaged throughout this book and there were tears as well as anger at times. I would recommend this book as a great read and will look for more by this author."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "This was my first encounter with a Tiffany Baker book. I really enjoy novels set in New England and this one didn't disappoint. Regionally, individuals are true to themselves, and at the same time, they absorb a certain persona from the \"speak\" and the ways of their surroundings.\"It had been twenty-odd years since June had stood in the dizzying swirl of being two people at once, the one you let people see and the one you kept buttoned close to your chest.\"And that is the fine thread that weaves through Mercy Snow. Like Eleanor Rigby from the Beatles' tune of \"the face that she kept in a jar by the door\" so go the characters of this book. Tiffany Baker introduces us to life in the small New Hampshire town of Titan Falls where lives are controlled and affected by the paper mill industry. Are the characters' destinies determined by their happenstance in life or more affected by their choices? And what exactly triggers the inclination toward a particular fork in the road?The female characters are showcased a step above their male counterparts. I was particularly intrigued with the character of Hazel who seemed to stay true to herself and to her commitments, and yet, she stretched across the page with growth and reinvention. I'd love for Ms. Baker to bring about a story seen through the eyes of Hazel....a woman's questionable past overlaid with footprints reaching towards a higher plane of existence.I definitely will be checking out previous books by Tiffany Baker and looking forward to future offerings."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/268108-deborah", "userReview": "feel I've been on a very fortunate trip having just finished \"Mercy Snow.\" It's one of those books that puts the heart back into reading. I felt such a loss of reading material that excited me over the holidays...and since that time, \"Burial Rites\" and \"Mercy Snow\" have both resurrected my belief in good books and fantastic authors. Tiffany Baker, in particular, is a gifted writer whose work is just captivating. I fell in love with her as an author when she wrote \"The Gilly Salt Sisters,\" but I have to say that this book really rivals that one!This is a haunting and gorgeously written book. There is much to be said about the workings of the characters. Their psychology leaves their outward appearance secondary as we become absorbed in their thought processes and machinations. As June, the mill owner's wife, spins her web catching herself up in it as well as the townswomen, we are reminded of how easy it is to fall in our own folly. We become desperate and hungry with Mercy and Hannah. And, we look with frustration at a situation that is both hateful and unfair from the goldfish bowl of the Gods...far above the action of the novel. This is a magical and meaningful book. Mystical and mythological bits and pieces dot the storyline reminding us that all that we see in the world may not be all there is to it. It's a story that draws you in and keeps the pages turning. There's more than one moral to this story.The mystery at the center of the novel keeps dancing at the edges of every chapter, leaving us grasping at it like a willow-the-wisp. While we are given a good deal of the actual mystery at the onset, the deeper ones are withheld from us, and we know it! This gives depth and richness to the storyline.I loved this book. It was one of those I wished would never end. I could happily have gone on reading about these characters...This is one of those books you just have to read this winter. It's a show-stopper of a novel. I highly recommend it!5 stars Deborah/TheBookishDame"}, {"userName": "Jeannine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805197-jeannine", "userReview": "Story about the fallout from a suspicious bus accident in a paper mill town in the northeast. The main character in this book is the town and the \"culture\" of living in a town dominated by a paper mill. The author goes on endlessly and repetitively about the family who owns the paper mill, the no good Snow family, and devotes too much ink to describing the murky river polluted by the mill and how murky it is, and oh, have we mentioned how polluted it is? (We get it. Move on).I made it through about 80 pages or so. I felt the characters were stereotypes/cliches. The sweet Mercy Snow (misunderstood, victim of her no-good family), the son of the mill owner (sweet, misunderstood, doesn't want to follow in the family business as is expected), the wife of the paper mill owner (cold-hearted, focusing on appearances, and yes, misunderstood), and the paper mill owner (mean, suspicious, underhanded), the old batty lady who raises sheep and sees Mercy's heart of gold. Blah blah blah.I was interested in reading a novel set in a paper mill town as I work in a town founded around a paper mill (said mill still in existence) and while I'm not originally from this area and don't work in the paper mill, I found a lot of the description and \"culture\" presented here to be over-dramatized and cliched."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "The Androscroggin River is a real waterway and the paper mills that lined its shore, the people that lived along its path all tell an important part of history. The author refers to this in her afterword and it served as a reminder to me that history takes many various shapes and forms.The MacAllister's have owned and run the paper mill for ages, they are town royalty. The mill is in Titan Falls, New Hampshire and most of the people there owe their livelihoods to this family. This novel is the story of an unwinding of a decades old mystery, of a marriage and a family, and of a town and way of life. Secrets always have a way of coming back to haunt those involved and once the secret is known, many find their lives changed. Some for the good, some for the bad, but inevitable all the same.June McAllister, a young woman whom in the past had married above her station into the MCAllister clan, feels that in many ways her husband had saved her from the horrible life she had lead before. She will do anything to protect that, even if a tiny voice says maybe she is wrong. The Snows are a family that the town considered losers, beneath them, corrupt, no good hangers on. They are a big part of the secret, in the past and the present. Hannah Snow is a youth girl who bones seem to talk to and Mercy Snow, a young woman is wise beyond her years, will do her best at healing the town, as she protects her family.Well written, wonderful mix of magical realism, very atmospheric with oh so interesting characters and a glimpse into the harm secrets can hold. To bring together or to tear apart. Love the ending as well, not everything ends happily nor should it, no matter how one wishes it could. Will not forget the character of Mercy, her name says much."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "This is a book about what it is like to live on the wrong side of the tracks in a small town where one family, the mill owners, rule the roost.It is probably a very good social commentary, but that is not what I was looking for when I picked this book to listen to.A tragic bus accident is blamed on Zeke Snow, one of the family group living in poverty on the outskirts of town. It is quickly apparent who is actually to blame for the accident, and a lot of time is spent on how it is covered up. The characters are all very black and white.

The characters had no depth or subtlety; the homespun vernacular used in both the dialogue and much of the POV exposition seemed unrealistic and overdone; and the rampant symbolism was as murky as the river running through the center of the story. Though I believe the time period of most of the action was meant to be about the mid-nineties, the old-fashioned scenes and settings seemed more like pre-WW2. Odd! Most egregious of all, the one character who so needed a comeuppance for the denouement to have any balance or satisfaction for me didn't really get it.

The livelihoods of almost all the residents depend on the paper mill and the McAllister family has owned it for generations. Cal and his wife June are Titan Falls royalty for whom opinions are not voiced, lips are sealed and secrets are kept \u2026 generations of secrets. Everyone knew the Snows were good for nothing n\u2019er-do-wells so the town breathed a collective sigh of relief when they thought the last of them had died. Soon enough a battered and rusty RV pulls into town carrying Mercy Snow, her brother Zeke and younger sister Hannah who have arrived to lay claim to their family\u2019s property. On the heels of their arrival, on a snowy night, the school bus is returning from taking the students on an evening trip to the movies and it is run off the road by an unknown car. Zeke\u2019s car is found not too far up the road wrapped around a tree and he is nowhere to be found. To all concerned its quite obvious who should be blamed for the driver\u2019s injuries and a young teen\u2019s death. But things are rarely as simple as they seem, especially in a town so very good at keeping grudges and even better at keeping secrets. I was quite excited to see another book by Ms. Baker as I enjoyed \u201cThe Gilly Salt Sisters\u201d and \u201cThe Little Giant of Aberdeen County\u201d so much. Her books always have a folksy, almost fairy tale, feel to them that I find appealing. This one is no exception. It has its share of mysticism, folk tales and remedies and people who are good at the core yet find themselves in difficult situations because of preconceived notions. Her good characters are never completely good, as her bad characters are never completely bad and the worst mess usually happens through good intentions. Ms. Baker never fails to draw me in to both the story and the setting with her writing.

Sheep and a red hand knit mitten were key elements of this book.My thoughts after reading this book...This book is about a bus accident that occurs on the way home from a field trip. It affects lots of people. Secrets long hidden are uncovered when Mercy Snow tries to prove her brother was not the driver who caused the bus to go off the road. Cal and his wife June own this paper mill. They are not very nice people. I liked June less and less throughout this book. They hold the life of this town in their hands and they are not admirable in their actions...at all.What I loved about this book...I so loved Mercy Snow...poor, hungry, sad and brave. I loved her little sister Hannah, too. I loved Hazel and her sheep and her yarns. This was a harsh story but it was filled with sweet bits of tenderness.What I did not love about this book...I did not love some of the sad parts with Hazel and her sheep but only because I love animals so much. Cal...so not fond of cheating Cal. He did not appear to be very honest or like able. I first thought that his wife June would be my favorite character but she turned out to be my least favorite.

The mill has always been a powerful fixture in the town and it still employs most of the men. Its success or failure has a direct effect on the well-being of the town, and its byproducts have tainted the Androscoggin River for years, certainly leading to a number of deaths and illnesses.One night a tragic bus accident rocks the town, holding two families in its sway\u2014the McCallisters, who run the mill, and the ne'er-do-well Snows, who had only recently returned to Titan Falls and now live on its fringes. When Zeke Snow is accused of causing the accident despite his innocence, his younger sister, Mercy, is determined to prove his innocence, while starting to embrace the mysterious gifts that have been handed down through generations of women in her family. All Mercy wants is normalcy, but trouble and scandal seem to follow her family wherever it goes.June McCallister, wife of the mill's owner, reinvented herself from the poor Florida girl she once was to the woman whose actions are followed by everyone in town. When she discovers some facts about the night of the accident, and how her own family was far more involved in events than anyone knows, she is determined to protect her husband and her son at any cost, no matter what it takes\u2014intimidation, innuendo, bribery, lies, even putting others at risk. June doesn't really want to know the full truth, about the accident or the Snows' ancestor, Gert, whose skeleton was uncovered the night of the accident, and to whom her husband's family may very well be linked.Mercy Snow is a book with a gothic feel. It's one where no one is quite what they seem, and there are more secrets than truths. It's a story about a town where the power of some has held dominion over others, no matter what the cost, and no one wants to be the one to speak out or ask questions. It's also a story about the strength of familial relationships and all that we'll do to protect the ones we love.This was an interesting and compelling book, and Tiffany Baker has a very evocative use of language. I wished there were a few more surprises in this book than there were; I felt as if once I got a handle on the plot and where it was going I was able to fairly accurately predict how the story would resolve itself. I also don't particularly enjoy books or movies where one character or group of characters hold all the cards and can manipulate everyone into doing what they want, even though it's wrong, although I know this happens in real life. But in the end, the star of this book is Baker's storytelling ability and the town of Titan Falls itself, both of which made the book worth reading."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "Titan Halls, New Hampshire, is a small town ruled by the paper mill and its owners, the McAllisters.

The prose are earthy, the characters well-drawn and the story is quite good overall.

This was somewhat reminiscent of \"The Sweet Hereafter\" by Russell Banks, but that one was much better."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "I picked up this book as I have read the other 2 books by this author and enjoyed them both. Plus, this one sounded like an intriguing one. Sadly, I was not feeling this book hardly at all. I liked Mercy but that was about it. No one else really stood out in this book for me. I found everyone else to be all about themselves but boring at the same time. I spent probably about a third of the way into the story before I skimmed part of the middle for a few and finally I just jumped ahead the the ending. No big surprise how the ending ended. In fact, I did not feel any relief for Mercy. I do hope the author's next book is better as I know she can do way better."}, {"userName": "Dan Radovich", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3404824-dan-radovich", "userReview": "Tiffany Baker continues to impress me with her writing skills. She takes you right into the heart of small town and makes you a resident - in all three of the novels that she has created. MERCY SNOW brings you to New Hampshire paper mill country where a bus accident threatens to reveal secrets of the 'ruling family'. Young Mercy Snow is just as strong a character as Truly Plaice from Baker's wonderful debut, LITTLE GIANT OF ABERDEEN COUNTY. Fans of Baker will not be disappointed, and new readers should want to grab her first two books to find out how talented she really is."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9561442-karen", "userReview": "I liked the wintery New Hampshire setting for this book. The images she creates of the Androscoggin River fouled by the logging industry and seemingly alive as it over-spreads its banks were vivid. The characters are intensely loyal and the siblings' struggle to care for each other is memorable. I would have liked more to have been written at the conclusion of the story. I felt chopped off from the emotions and experiences of the characters."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36191634-brenda", "userReview": "This is a book about a long-standing feud between two families that comes to a head after a tragic bus accident.

Like many other mills, with tougher environmental regulations and higher operating costs in general, the mill is struggling to stay afloat.The McAllister family consists of Cal, who runs the mill and frequently cheats on his wife, June, Smith College educated, somewhat unhappy with her life in Titan Falls and her husband Cal\u2019s \u2019s indiscretions, June busies herself with her appearance, sewing groups, and protecting her son Nate and her family\u2019s reputation.The \u201chave-nots\u201d of this story are the Snows, an orphaned set of siblings who have just come into town to park their run-down RV on a plot of land that has been in their family. There is some unsettling history with their ancestors who once resided there. Gert Snow was a woman who died under suspicious circumstances in the town. The siblings, Mercy Snow, older brother Zeke and smart as whip 9-year old sister Hannah are dirt-poor. With almost no money, Zeke even hunts for food while Mercy tries to find work tending the sheep of a townswoman named Hazel.Hazel, who had been an orphan herself, gives Mercy a chance and sees that she is excellent with her flock. Hazel's husband Abel is in a coma and fighting for his life. Abel was driving a school bus that was driven off the road and killed a local girl. After the crash officials are quick to blame Zeke as the one who caused the accident. His feisty sister Mercy is driven to prove he was not to blame, but she has her job made tougher by June McAllister and her determination to send the Snow\u2019s on their way.This was a quick and enjoyable read for me. It\u2019s part mystery and there were interesting revelations along the way that held my interest and kept me quickly turning the pages. Except for son Nate, I thought that the McAllister\u2019s were a despicable couple. I loved spunky little sister Hannah, and her love of books and reading, even if she did take the books from public libraries in various locales. Mercy Snow was a strong character who deserved to have the novel named after her. I cheered for her again and again.The audio version is read by Christine Lakin who did a great job.Although, I enjoyed Mercy Snow, the author\u2019s debut novel, The Little Giant of Aberdeen County, still remains a favorite of mine.4/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "ReputationsThe aptly named Mercy Snow is a young woman who\u2019s never had a proper home. She and her family have always lived on the fringes, traveling from place to place, barely making enough to buy food and gas for their RV. She and her older brother Zeke, and 9 year old sister Hannah have recently lost their mother and moved back to the family homestead in rural New Hampshire on the outskirts of a one business town, Titan Falls. Unfortunately the Snows have never been welcome by the town\u2019s folk especially the town leaders... The local paper mill has always been run by the McAllister\u2019s and the current owner is Cal and he and his wife June and 17 year old son Nate are considered the leaders of the community. Things aren\u2019t going well at the mill. Many such mills throughout the area have already shut down because of out of country competition and the expense of meeting tough environmental laws to keep the local river free from industrial pollution. Things become even more grim when the local youth group\u2019s bus is run off the road by a careless driver with fatal results. The Snows are blamed. Most of the action is seen from June\u2019s perspective though that alternates with other key characters. June is an enigma. The way she sees herself doesn\u2019t jibe with how others see her. She\u2019s alternately seen as an upstanding rich wife and leading citizen of Titan Falls, as grasping, high handed, arrogant, a clinging wife and anxious mother though, of course, she sees herself quite differently. In her own eyes she\u2019s only doing what she needs to do to protect her family. Mercy Snow is another study in contrasts. She\u2019s also doing what she needs to do to care for her much younger sister though they\u2019re barely hanging on and sometimes close to starvation. The ladies of the village see the Snows as bad seeds, the cause of whatever goes wrong in the area. The perceptions of and about these two women provides the main interest in this mystery. It\u2019s an interesting character analysis and the mystery is believable and has a satisfactory conclusion though the small part that the paranormal aspects play in the book comes across as silly.An e-copy was provided by the publisher for review purposes.(Disclaimer given as required by the FTC.)"}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20005860-pat", "userReview": "Mercy Snow is a somber, philosophical story. It's setting is in New Hampshire, along the Androscoggin River (Wikipedia), during the 1990's.June McAllister thought she had everything she ever wanted. Her husband was the owner of the Titan Falls paper mill. The paper mill was central to the survival of almost everyone in this backwoods town. This made the McAllister's a very prominent family. Three extremely poor, orphaned, Snow children, Mercy, Zeke and Hannah, reclaim their nearby property and everything changes.The author, Tiffany Baker, provides rich descriptions of the area and the filthy, dangerous river. She richly describes the poor Snow family's pitiful living conditions and struggle to survive during the brutal winter in contrast to the McAllister's comfortable life.This story pivots around June's husband and Mercy Snow's brother being involved in a deathly bus accident. The two women are at odds with each other. In the end they both get some of what they wished for, but for a price. Mercy Snow reminds me of the idiom: Be careful of what you wish for, because you just might get it. (What does Be Careful What You Wish For Mean? (WiseGeek))A bright spot in this story is Hazel, the bus driver's wife, who like Mercy, is a survivor. She raises sheep and unlike most of the people in the area, is not dependent on the paper mill. Another bright spot is that Mercy Snow seems to have inherited her mother's healing ability which adds a certain bit of magic to the plot.There are many facets to this story and interesting characters which made Mercy Snow an enjoyable read.I would like to thank author, Tiffany Baker, the She Reads Organization and the publisher, Grand Central Publishing, Hachette Book Group, for providing me with this book, free of charge, for review.My Book Blog: http://postingfornow.com"}], "description": "In the tiny town of Titan Falls, New Hampshire, the paper mill dictates a quiet, steady rhythm of life.
