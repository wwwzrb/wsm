Bloody hell.You need this book. You want it. The cover alone is worth having it.This book is one of the best examples of queer representation that I have encountered to this day.Not only are the main characters far from cis/straight/white but so is most of this book's cast. Let's start with Angel and Jimmy.Angel is an 18-year-old Muslim girl, whose greatest passion is The Ark, a famous boyband. She loves this band, even though she may not actually be in love with them. Jimmy is one out of the three members of The Ark. He is a trans guy, who struggles with anxiety and panic attacks. He loves his band members and his grandpa more than anything in this world.What I found refreshing is that Angel's and Jimmy's sexuality is not a plot point in this book. It's part of them, but it doesn't define every aspect of their lives. They are their own people. Who they love does not matter, what matters is that they love them. The same can be applied to all of the other characters. What is most important is that none of this feels forced. Not only do we have a rainbow of sexuality and gender-fluidity, but the diversity in this book perfectly reflects this world's multiculturalism. As I said before, this is Alice Oseman's best book so far, especially plot-wise. It's a strongly character-driven book but what happens in it is equally exciting. I was drawn into the story right from the beginning. When I first heard that Alice was writing a novel about a fangirl and her favourite band, I wasn't sure if I would like it. Even though I knew that Alice was an exceptional writer, I didn't think that I could relate to a boyband-obsessed main character and the superfamous male counterpart. I expected this story to be a romantic one - but I should have known better. Even though we get to see a few kisses and crushes, the focus is on friendship, faith and respect. The characters were all relatable, even though some of them are more sympathetic than others. I don't want to tell you too more than that this story will surprise you.The only flaw that I could find was that the plot took a somewhat messy turn towards the end. It might have needed more structure, more of a direction to remain realistic. I felt like there was too much going on at the same time. I also wished for more closure at the end, even though I like it when stories have more of an open end. But this was a wee bit too open to make me satisfied. The only thing that is left to be said is that I am desperate to know what The Ark actually sounds like. I'd love to hear Joan of Arc for real. I might be a bit obsessed with these boys, too.Thanks to the team at HarperCollins for providing me with this beautiful review copy!Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "A new Alice Oseman book.After Radio Silence blew me away, I became fascinated with this author who, by the way, published her first novel at nineteen. I\u2019m twenty, going on twenty-one, and what have I put into this world? A couple of reviews. Do they count? Let\u2019s say they do, for the sake of my sanity. This is the story of Angel and Jimmy, two teenagers from two different worlds. Angel is a fangirl, whereas Jimmy is the one people fangirl or fanboy over\u2014he\u2019s a famous and transgender singer from the band The Ark. And somehow, these two meet and connect.You think you know how a story is going to unfold\u2026 Only to realize that your imagination must be working overtime because this is nothing like you expected. Am I the only one who was waiting for Angel and Jimmy to fall in love?Alice Oseman is great at making you root for two characters to be together. Now I understand why her two previous novels explicitly say in their descriptions something like \u201cthis is not a love story.\u2019\u2019So, as we have established, this is not a conventional love story. Or a love story, period. Angel\u2019s love for Jimmy is selfish, because this music group makes her feel better\u2014it gives meaning to *her* life. And yet, even if the plot went into a completely different direction than I first anticipated, it was very interesting. See, Jimmy doesn\u2019t have it all figured out, and neither does Angel. Their interactions are precious, because they help each other realize what\u2019s important to them\u2014and that is not selfish at all. It\u2019s realistic, the characters relatable, the tone light but serious when needed, the pacing perfect and, above it all, full of themes.It takes an extremely long amount of time for Angel and Jimmy to meet, so they don\u2019t have as many interactions together as I would have liked, but I love these two characters to pieces. What can I say? Alice Oseman did it again.

It wasn't quite as good as Radio Silence in my opinion, that one is still my favourite of Alice's! But the book was still really well written! She's such a talented author What I liked about this book: - Hijabi main character, half indian main character, Nigerian supporting characters (poc all around!) - Bisexual, trans male, and Gay characters - Great portrayal of anxiety - Alice just writes such great characters that just feel so real - I love how the characters develop over the book and how they kind of 'find themselves' - Portrayal of the good and bad sides of fandom culture - Character friendships - Positive portrayal of internet friendships What I didn't like - the general plot just wasn't quite for me, I can't quite explain it, i liked the characters journeys, but there was just something about the plot that I can't quite explain, I just wasn't quite feeling it haha, which is the only reason I knocked off a star!"}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "Probably more of a 3.5 but I suspect that has a lot to do with my total disinterest in contemporary novels. It's always the same. It was the same with Sandhya Menon's lovely When Dimple Met Rishi. Like this one, it was a very nice, soothing story with great characters, but just not 100% my jam. I just don't think it's fair to rate a novel lower because I personally cannot be arsed with the contemporary genre. That's not on the book; it's on me. But this was a very sweet, heartful little book, and the characters were easy to get behind. Was it always believable? No, but I'm not really looking to read a book that's the same as real life. Real life is boring and messy and exhausting and it's full of irritating moments that aren't ever resolved. They just stay irritating forever. That's adulthood for you. I'm not the target audience, and I'm aware of that. For teens, I'm sure this book will resonate really deeply. The representation was carefully, thoughtfully done. It's a bit too long, and it's also bougie as hell, but I imagine teens don't want to read about scrambling around for pennies for the bus or trying to make dinner out of a packet of Space Raiders and a questionable onion or showing the whites of your eyes whenever you glance at your bank statement. That's fine. This book holds enough social weight as it is, and it holds it very well. It's clear that a lot of care and attention was paid to the details of the representation and that's very valuable. The family relationships were beautifully crafted, as were the friendships. It's a cool, exciting take on fame and fandom, and the two protagonists had very distinctive voices that were easy to become invested in. I listened to this on audio, and the narrators were absolutely phenomenal. They made for a smooth, easy listening little treat on a Sunday afternoon while I sat in the lukewarm bathtub and worried about the water-damaged floor. Why does it creak so loudly?I'd say this is perfect for people who enjoy contemporary novels. Nicely written, easy to read, well characterised, and the audiobook was a goddamn feast for the ears. I want the dude narrator to give constant commentary on my life. Imagine it. \"She stared longingly out of the smudgy office window, in soul many miles away. And the constant thought remained there, an ever-present ghost haunting the halls of her mind: Why is the bathroom floor so creaky?\""}, {"userName": "Romie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33510193-romie", "userReview": "\u201cThey felt like the reason I was born was to . . . love them.\u201dYou know when your favourite writer comes up with a new book, you always get both excited and terrified, because what if this book isn\u2019t what you had expected it to be? But then it turns out even better. Because of course it\u2019s better than expected, your favourite writer wrote it. I think Alice Oseman is brillant. I think her books are out of this world. And I cannot wait to read all the books she will write in the future, because if there is one author I deeply trust, it\u2019s her.This story is written from both Angel and Jimmy\u2019s perspective and it adds honestly so much to the story. It\u2019s not just a story with two main characters and their paths cross. It\u2019s more than that. Angel is a 18-years-old hijabi and she lives for The Ark, she would die for the members of this boy band. Jimmy is a 19-years-old biracial transgender guy, and he\u2019s one of the three members of The Ark. Let me stop you even before you start thinking about a potential love story between these because nope, it\u2019s not going to happen. Jimmy is gay and Angel \u201cprobably would go out with a girl, but I don\u2019t really ever get crushed on anyone, so I just don\u2019t know what I am right now, to be honest.\u201d This isn\u2019t a story about them falling in love, so relax \u2014 sounds like something I\u2019ve already said about Radio Silence to my friends lol.Angel is part of The Ark fandom, Jimmy is part of the band. Two perspectives, one story. While Angel only sees the perfect part of being famous, only sees her idols and their smiles, Jimmy is living the reality, and the reality isn\u2019t always pretty. This book deals with what it means to be a fan, to be so obsessed and in love with something that you cannot stop thinking about something else and your life ends up revolving around it. Angel loves The Ark, it\u2019s her reason to wake up every day, it\u2019s why she smiles \u2026 she doesn\u2019t really know who she is if she isn\u2019t part of this huge fandom. Jimmy obviously loves The Ark as well, but the fame that came with being part of worsened his anxiety disorder, made his panic attacks more and more frequent. When Angel sees Jimmy with a smile on his face, she doesn\u2019t that he\u2019s internally screaming, this is why this dual perspective is brillant, it allows us to know the real story.This story is also about friendships made on the internet. To meet their idols and go to one of their concerts, Angel and her online friend Juliet decide to meet for the first time in real life and spend the week together at Juliet\u2019s grandma\u2019s house. It\u2019s both of them realising people aren\u2019t necessarily the same on internet or irl, and it\u2019s okay, because some of people are way more confident on the internet and shy when they have to talk to someone face to face.It may not be that amazing for you, but this book has two bisexual side characters and I loved them with all my heart. Bliss and Lister were absolutely amazing, and I was happy to see myself represented in them because they\u2019re the absolute best. Then we have Rowan, the third member of our band, and he\u2019s probably the one who took me the longest time to like, but I understand where he\u2019s coming from and I respect him.This book owns my heart, pretty much like every book Alice Oseman has ever written. And I\u2019m okay with that.Thank you so much Harper Collins for providing me a physical arc in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34560596-jackie", "userReview": "bless Alice Oseman for helping me get over my book hangover -UM HELLO I JUST GOT APPROVED FOR AN ARC OF THIS AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED SCREAMING. 2018 TRULY IS THE YEAR OF THE GAYS (aka me and Em) GETTING WHAT THEY DESERVE-LOOK WE HAVE A COVER!!!!!!!! i'm honestly so freaking excited for this book, i love Alice Oseman with all my heart and i watched all of her Book 3 diaries last year so i'm emotionally INVESTED in this book. this is one of my 3 MOST (!!!) anticipated releases of the year (next to Restore Me and Heart of Iron) so i obviously have it preordered and oh my gOd CAN IT BE MAY ALREADY"}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4785714-lily", "userReview": "I was sent an ARC copy of the book by the publisher HarperCollins, thank you so much for sending it to me! This was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, with Radio Silence being one of my all time favourite contemporaries. I was a little hesitant going into it as I saw it was centred on a boyband which I'm usually not interested in, but I trusted Alice to deliver and I was totally right to do so. I think Radio Silence will always be my favourite and have a special place in my heart, but this definitely did not disappoint. Alice Oseman is honestly just a master of creating relatable, intricate and realistic teenage characters that you instantly connect to and care about. They're all such wonderful little cinnamon rolls, I just really want to give Angel Rahimi and Jimmy Kaga-Ricci a hug. The book is told from both of their povs and even though it shifts between them quite a lot, I was never confused and found their voices to both be really distinct. Alice's books I've found are very character driven, with this one following them both through a very tumultuous week in which their paths cross and how it affects them, and I enjoyed following them on that journey from beginning to end. The friendships in this book are also wonderful, again I'm pretty sure Alice Oseman writes some of my favourite friendships in books ever. They're all so complex, especially the relationships between the three boys who make up the band The Ark, but ultimately they all love and care about it and it's so soft!! more soft friendships between boys pls!!! There's also rep of internet friendships through Angel's plot which was so validating to read as someone who spent a lot of their teen years online and still talks to many of their internet friends to this day. There is also so much rep in this book that's just weaved into the story!! There is representation for: a muslim hijabi girl, a trans boy, anxiety, bisexuality, gay, mixed race characters, black, and working class characters as well. I can only speak for the anxiety and bisexuality rep which I thought was really well done, but I know that sensitivity readers were hired for the two POV characters and Alice did a lot of research when writing this novel. Still, I would encourage you to seek out #ownvoices reviews of this book for the rep I mentioned. Ultimately, this book talks about fandom and fame and putting people on a pedestal and how toxic it can be to idolise someone on both sides. As someone who has been involved in fandoms and definitely idolised people when I was younger, this was a really interesting topic to read about and I think it was handled really sensitively. It also discusses the idea of letting something consume you to the point of it being unhealthy and how that affects your relationships and how you think about yourself. Again, this was treated really well and is definitely something topical for teenagers and adults to think about.I will also just say, like Radio Silence, this book was extremely readable for me. I read it in about a day, which considering I was dealing with navigating public transport to London to see Hamilton in the snow was a miracle, but is a testament to how addictive and readable Alice's books are. Overall, this was again an extremely relatable, nuanced and fun read that deals with relevant and sometimes difficult topics. I honestly think Alice writes some of the best YA contemporary out there at the moment, and at least for me, just really reflect my teenage experience (this is probably helped by the fact Alice and I are a similar age and I spent a lot of time on the internet as a teenager - but I stand by my point!!). This book will be out in the UK in May and I really encourage you to read it when it's out!!"}, {"userName": "Aleksandra", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40511295-aleksandra", "userReview": "No rating.No giving the book a star rating is rare for me and I'll get to whys in a minute, but first I need to say this.I Was Born For This is exceptional contemporary novel about teens and fandom and music. Alice Oseman just gets it, the fandom and this culture in all its glory and pain and struggles. She created a masterfully written novel, the writing, the plot composition, the realness of the events! The protagonists are 18 year old hijabi brown girl who's a fan of The Ark and 19 year old biracial (South-Asian-Italian) trans gay guy, who's a singer in The Ark boy band. The novel isn't about their identities, it's about fandom and love and music. Alice Oseman has grown so much as a writer since her debut novel Solitaire.I do recommend to read the book, because:a) It's a great readb) It's a mirror of harmful fandom moments and people need to see it and to adjust their behaviorc) It's a great story about friendships, I'm sure everyone who's ever be in a fandom will find joyful and relatable moments in the book.d) The book has many diverse character and the author has done a great job!To elaborate on things I enjoyed in the book:(yes I like making lists when I'm nervous, shush)\u2022 The plot is so so good! The story composition of two separate plot lines weaving together works especially great here because we are able to see two sides of the fandom: the band and the fandom for them, the artists and the fans. It gives a unique perspective of following both of these stories, seeing them as real people. If it were one-sided the message wouldn't work.And I believe the message of the novel is \nStop being a dick to your fellow humans you dick\n. Probably not in that words, exactly...\u2022 The diverse cast of characters! Lovable, infuriating, complex realistic characters. The two povs have unique voice, the personalities come through on the page.Fereshteh \"Angel\" Rahimi is a fangirl of boy band The Ark, it's her main love and joy in life. She's average at studies, she's going to average university and she's okay with it. She has The Ark.I love her relationship with her parents. It's a loving realistic portrayal of family dynamics. Angel and Juliet friendship has gone through ups and downs in the book. It's been entertaining to follow them.I love that Angel doesn't know her sexuality, she says she doesn't get crushes but she might be willing to go out with the girl. Angel is 18 and she doesn't pay too much attention to figuring out her sexuality, and it's fine, I haven't met any characters like her in fiction before.I like Angel, but ironically her behavior made me super uncomfortable and it's the reason I'm confused about how to rate the book. But later about it.Jimmy Kaga-Ricci is the other protagonist. He's a singer in the most popular boy band in Europe (soon to be the world?). He loves music, he has wanted to be in a band since he was a kid. And he did it with his best friend Rowan and his pal Lister. But fame, constant pressure etc haven't gone without consequences. Jimmy has panic attacks and severe anxiety. He's prone to paranoia. The fame that brought money, amazing opportunities, also brought insatiable fans and pressure to perform more, do more interviews. He doesn't have me-time anymore. It's important that he realizes how privileged he is, but it doesn't make his struggle less real. And being trans gay in famous band brings all type of humans, trash humans including.The other two band members are Rowan and Lister. Rowan is black straight guy, he's very caring and responsible. Rowan & Jimmy friendship is precious. I love that Rowan wears dresses to perform. Screw toxic masculinity, am I right. Lister is bisexual disaster and I love him. Lister loves partying, he won several The Sexiest Man alive awards by various magazines. Also Lister is an alcoholic. It's addressed and discussed in text. Lister is from single parent family, he grew up poor and having resources to support his mother is important to him.The book has a whole cast of amazing characters. I loved Juliet and Bliss, who are friends of Angel. Mac is the epitome of straight white dude, it would be fun if it's weren't so painful and cringey. I love the casual use of they/them pronouns, it was literally just one sentence but it warms my heart.Special shoutout to Jimmy's grandfather who's the best granddad ever.\u2022 The writing is flowing so naturally and beautifully. It's so easy to read, the language the character use is very appropriate for their age. Alice Oseman gets all of the aspects of writing teen characters.\u2022 The portrayal of fandoms, fandom culture, toxic and marvelous aspects of being part of the fandom is very accurate. I'm sure the book will be a fun read for both fandom and non-fandom readers.Personally I've never been part of a band fandom or any real life celebrities fandoms, it was interesting to see that part of the Internet.\u2022 In many aspects a wholesome book, I would call it a must-read of 2018 if you like contemporaries, fluffy, fun and serious.\u2022 The idea of maybe giving as much love to their own selves as they give to the fandom. Love thyself.\u2022 The religious themes, the religious main characters (Muslim & Christian).And why haven't I given the book shining 5 star rating?The issue mostly lies in the first 40% of the book. Real people shipping is gross. Imagining real people in a relationship, getting all intense about it is not okay. Supporting couples who are openly in a relationship is one thing, but creating those romantic scenarios and then getting furious when the people whom you are shipping with each other don't deliver. It is harmful. It is dehumanizing.Angel is a shipper of Jowan aka Rowan + Jimmy. It made me so uncomfortable reading about her going on and on about it, especially after reading Jimmy's pov chapters and seeing how much hurt that shipping is doing to them.The author clearly doesn't approve of it. The whole story is based on it not being okay. Angel stops at once when she realizes that it's not going to be \"canon\" ever. I don't want to go into many details because spoilers.Angel sees the harm that thing has done. But for so many pages I cringed and suffered. I can't bring myself to give the book high rating. It's that personal pet peeve that I just can't stand. Maybe if it wasn't as constant as it were, I wouldn't mind...Is it a valid reason to not give the book a rating? Yes, because it's my review and my rating and my feelings and I can do what I want.I don't want to give a book a low rating because it doesn't deserve it.After writing at such length about good aspects of the novel, I'm sad my impression of the book has been ruined, but I want possible readers of my review be informed on The Good so they'll pick the book and give Alice Oseman their love.I might come back to this book and this review and reconsider things, but not today."}, {"userName": "Lauren James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254869-lauren-james", "userReview": "I cried, I laughed, I fell in love. and this is just the first draft! pretty sure this is gonna slay me when it's edited.Alice Oseman was born to write this novel.

I mean, Radio Silence will probably forever be my favorite of her books because it felt like my book soulmate, but this book? Beautiful. I wish I could send all my love to Alice. You know when fans say \"You should be grateful to *insert author's name here* for writing this book because it's their gift!\" every time someone criticizes their favorite author's writing? I always roll my eyes whenever I see one of those comments because hello? It's not a gift, it's a product. Or, it could be a gift maybe, but not as much as it's a product to market and earn money from. Yeah, I'm THAT annoying person. Or I was, because after reading this book I'm seriously considering my stance on the whole book gift thing. You know why? Because this book is really a gift to the universe! Alice's books are always full of the kind of radiant, wholesome energy that I hope will possess the whole world, and every time I read one of her novels I feel like my already mushy heart is expanding to accommodate all this new mushiness.Basically, I have been reformed by this book. Amen.First off, I would like to bring everyone's attention to this masterpiece of a quote: \nMac looks like he posts #like4like selfies on Instagram.\n I dare you to give me a character description better than that.BORN TO SURVIVE THE STORMThe story follows Angel Rahimi, a hijabi Muslim teen whose world practically revolves around The Ark, a famous boy band. The book starts when she arrived at London to meet her online friend Juliet and attend The Ark's meet-and-greet and concert, but the story really started picking up when Angel met Jimmy Kaga-Ricci, a biracial gay trans musician and the vocalist of The Ark. What I love the most about I Was Born for This is the fact that it's so un-romanticized. Sure, Angel had starry-eyed ideas of her idols at first, but the way the story slowly unfolded pretty much washed all of that away so that in the end Angel had a much different view of the people she idolize. The thing is, I am very pro-fandom, but fandoms in general tend to dehumanize public figures, and a lot of times I've seen this dehumanization justified by saying \"But they are public figures, PUBLIC!!!!\" which is not fair at all. They might be public figures, but they are humans first and foremost.The dual narration really worked perfectly for this book.BORN TO SURVIVE THE FLOODThe characters in this book are, as usual, well-written. I don't really want to go into much detail about them because I feel like it would be better if you discover their greatness by yourself, but here's a summary of how I feel about the characters here:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I LOVE THEM MY SWEET PRECIOUS CINNAMON ROLLS BABY AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!That's all.\n\"...everyone\u2019s normal, everyone\u2019s weird, everyone\u2019s just trying to deal with their own life and keep calm and carry on. And hold on to something that\u2019ll keep them going.\"\nThis book has a lot of important messages about fandoms, friendships, yada yada, but I think the most important message here is about learning to accept and love yourself. It gives the message of \"Love yourself!\" without seeming overpreachy like one of those Instagram accounts that post motivational quotes on nature pictures. It doesn't imply that you should love yourself first because otherwise no one would love you, and all that bullcrap. For me, what this book is saying is that it's great to have things you are passionate about, but it doesn't hurt if one of the things you're passionate about is yourself\nIn an otherwise mediocre existence, we choose to feel passion.\nAnd it's wonderful."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45686441-natasha", "userReview": "Review also on my blog \u2022 Twitter \u2022 BookstagramRep:\u00a0biracial (Indian and Italian) anxious gay trans guy mc, Persian Muslim Hijabi who's questioning her sexuality mc, side black character, side bisexual character, side biracial (Chinese and white) bisexual character\u00a0Content warnings:\u00a0injury, panic attacks\u00a0So if you don't know, Alice Oseman's\u00a0Radio Silence\u00a0is my favourite book of all time. That made me really excited for this book. And I overall really enjoyed it.\u00a0The book is told in a duel-perspective, changing from Angel, a girl who is a huge fan of a band called The Ark, and Jimmy, a boy who is part of The Ark.Angel is really into The Ark's fandom and I loved that part of the book. I think it was portrayed so well overall, from the fan's dedication, to shipping, to even uncalled for hatred for member's girlfriends. As I was in the All Time Low fandom on Tumblr for a number of years, this mirrored a lot of what I experienced and saw (ironically, a side character was an All Time Low fan too, which I freaking loved). Angel wasn't the kind that hated a girlfriend by default but she was into shipping Jimmy with his bandmate Rowan. It's handled in a pretty realistic way. Although, I'm surprised Angel didn't at all acknowledge people who would've been against the ship, since that would also be common. Also, even just a reference to either Jimmy or Rowan being shipped with the third band member, I think adding that would've been good too. I also loved how the book really validated online friendships. That's something you rarely see in fiction and I feel like the book portrayed it really well.Another thing about Angel I loved was that she did on the low end of average in school while trying hard. Not only that but she's okay with it. The book doesn't portray her not being an academic person as a bad thing. It also didn't portray it from a lack of trying, since people who do try hard in their school and uni work and get average grades do exist. It was really validating and something really important to talk about since typically when character's grades are talked about, it's always high marks. So I really appreciated this book portrayed a character who tried and still didn't excel highly, that's the reality for most.\u00a0I really loved Jimmy at a character. He's getting really anxious due to fame and pressure that's been thrown onto him. He was already dealing with an anxiety disorder, and has been experiencing worse and worse panic attacks. His portrayal was interesting, one of the things he's very adamantly against is claims of fans saying they 'love him' due to them not knowing him at all. That was a great input and it later prompts Angel to wonder if she loves Jimmy or just the idea of Jimmy, which was also done so well. Jimmy was an overall great character, and you completely understand his struggles.\u00a0I also loved his friendship with his band mates. Rowan his his best friend, which contributes a lot to the shipping of them. It was a really realistic friendship, they sometimes fought but they clearly still cared about each other. The third band member Lister, is kind of the third wheel since he's only in the band because Jimmy and Rowan needed a drummer. But it's clear that the three did have a certain connection.One thing I didn't love was that it dragged at times. It's mostly character driven so it made it a little dull at times. I also found the duel-perspective to be a little whiplash-y at times before the mid way point. It was used well at some points though.\u00a0I overall really liked this book and I'm looking forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7534484-marie", "userReview": "I AM STILL SCREAMING ABOUT THIS IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE AND MORE.

I love the way she makes me feel\u00a0things.\u00a0I end up falling in love with all the characters (maybe bar a few) and simultaneously want to adopt them and protect them from the world. But sometimes, I'm angry, because Oseman's novels can be so relatable that I can see myself in the characters or the story, so I get sad that she's made me self-reflect like that when I was PERFECTLY FINE ignoring my problems thank you very much!Boy band lit is something I very rarely read, however it's something I love to write about and have had minor success with when it comes to posting stories online (fanfiction excluded!). Usually when I find a boy band lit plot, it's something that I'm just not interested in; it's about a member of a boy band falling in love with the teenage female protagonist and all other variants of that plotline. While I think boy band lit is something I would definitely enjoy, there's just not enough diversity in the genre. But HEY, THANK GOD ALICE OSEMAN WROTE ONE.I\u00a0loved\u00a0I Was Born For This, and while I felt a little less dread and hopelessness after it, unlike after reading Radio Silence and Solitaire, I still felt that overwhelming you get after reading an Alice Oseman book, which is NOTHING IS REAL ART IS LIE HERE'S ALL OF THESE FEELINGS.Fan culture and obsession over boy bands/celebrities is something I've been interested in for a long time. I've written essays about it, discussed it in my own stories, and love reading other people's perspectives on it. I remember when that documentary about the fans of One Direction came out on Channel 4 years ago and how it divided the public, even the fans. I think fan culture is such a large part of our lives that it's strange that there aren't that many published novels on the topic, or even articles that aren't degrading and downright rude.But let's get back to I Was Born For This.Angel is a wonderful character. Despite not being a teenager anymore (and getting to the point where I'm not In The Know about how teens speak/act), Angel felt like such a realistic British teen, and that's what Oseman is so great at writing. It's authentic, it comes from experience. She has worries and fears that aren't uncommon but are often overlooked in contemporary YA, or may not even be relatable when it comes to USYA. I loved Jimmy too, and found myself shouting 'me too!' when his anxiety about the small things overpowered him so much that he didn't feel safe outside of his own home and sometimes even inside it (very me). Oseman's stories are always very character driven and I loved that each character in I Was Born For This felt like a living, breathing person who felt so real that if I stopped reading and googled them, there they'd be.And to be honest, I'm kinda sad that the band The Ark don't exist. I would stan hard - but not too hard that I invade privacy or ship them. Help I just wanna be a good fan!"}, {"userName": "Amelia Oswald", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45878598-amelia-oswald", "userReview": "Internet friends meet in real life. Sound familiar, fangirls ? Yeah I thought so . ----------------------------------------------I was born for this    Amazing how everything can change within the space of a few hours    I haven\u2019t felt this related since Eliza and Her Monsters and boy oh boy I mean internet friends became real life friend is me. I\u2019ve met my facebook friend almost 2 years ago and things has been great. I hang out with her more than I hang out with my friends at the university. We both like the same singer at the time (okay it was Taylor Swift, I know so clich\u00e9 ). No actually we both like Taylor Swift it\u2019s just me as a Taylor Swift fan (aka swifty) and she was a Directioner (I\u2019m not a fan of that boyband though). It\u2019s kinda weird when we met in a Harry Potter theme coffee shop but it\u2019s only me who read and watch Harry Potter, she didn\u2019t even watch the movie but I still like her and now I consider her as my best friend. I think I both feel related and unrelated with the characters. Because we are not in the same fandom so we usually talk about things that didn\u2019t related to our idol, mostly about our daily lives really. But I can feel relate to Angel in a thing that I feel comfortable with express myself in the internet rather than in real life. Real life is really hard sometime and I get that and sometime we need to escape from it and internet might be a great place at a time. Other than her I have met other three former swifties (we both feel like we are too old for that fandom war and other drama, we just simply enjoy the music). Anyway, I feel like my friend can feel more relate than me because she actually in a fandom of a boy band (just like the book). There are diversity in this book we couldn\u2019t deny that. The female narrator is Muslim and I\u2019m glad that the author made her an average girl just liked everyone else. But just because she is \u201can average girl\u201d doesn\u2019t not mean she isn\u2019t special in her own way. And we have a transgender guy dealing with mental illness (more specific panic attack) which makes we feel more real , more connected with celebrities. It makes we realize that he is also a person, he has his own issue and he isn\u2019t perfect. After I read the book I feel really ashamed of myself sometime (I don't usually ship any real life celebrities, but I still do) because I think I shouldn\u2019t have shipped anyone who are real life person, they have their private lives and we should respect that, it is different from fiction characters because like us they have feelings. So I read the Acknowledgements and she did doing research about experiences of being transgender and Muslim by interviewing, interacting with a number of people in those community which is great because many authors don\u2019t even do that so the representation usually gone wrong.Angel and Jimmy didn\u2019t interact with each other until after \u00be of the book. And the meeting well it was awkward. He threatened her with a knife and he was having a panic attack. And for Angel, she realized that he was not the person she knew and adored, he was a stranger to her but she still recovered from that and then tried to help him because she was kind and she some how knew that he needed help. And the band they were friend from middle grade, but it felt like they didn\u2019t have much connection with each other, they both feel lonely and didn\u2019t know how to over come that especially Lister and Jimmy all they longed for were to feel belong to someone, Jimmy only wanted his grandad because that was the only person could make him feel connected with the past and he was his home. For Lister he always feel left out from the group, and that make him behave the way he is in the book, I don\u2019t know if it were a great excuse for it but what\u2019s really sad is that he is so afraid of being hated by Jimmy for what he did out of jealousy. Bliss is cool even though she just make a brief appearance in the book.Angel is using a band and the internet to escape her reality , when she met a person that she could become real life friend, all she talk about was the band and not her life when her friend only want to know her more which is really fucked up. Little thing I like about the book: -\tThat scene when they revealed their real name was hilarious. -\tBliss Lai because she is awesome -\t\u201cToo soon\u201d -\tMac being called out In the end we should answer this question:  Do you ever feel like nobody knows the real you ?"}, {"userName": "\u24d5\u24d0\u24e3\u24d8\u24dc\u24d0 [hiatus]", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17439639-hiatus", "userReview": "I LOVED THIS BOOK SOOO GODDAMN MUCH\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udc9bI seriously want to see The Ark perform Joan of Arc or just let me read the entire lyrics really, pleeeeaase??!!So, I'm just gonna go draw a sketch of my smol bean Jimmy wearing black angel wings or smth anD YOU SHOULD GO READ THIS BOOK"}, {"userName": "evelyn hugo\u2019s #1 fan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62555306-evelyn-hugo-s-1-fan", "userReview": "alice oseman is my favourite author of all time, and of course this was more incredible then i ever could've imagined. also i would die for jimmy aka the best and most purest book character of all time jssecond read and many more to come let's be fucken honest"}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42163117-emma", "userReview": "alice oseman is officially my favorite contemporary writer. her stories are brilliant and sensitive and diverse, and their reflections on friendship, identity, internet culture, and art just feel real in a way that very, very few books i've read in my lifetime can achieve.i'm super behind on reviews after finals, so if i don't get the chance to come back and add to this later please know that it was absolutely stunning and i highly recommend this book!! it's about fandom, fame, and friendship, and features an iranian hijabi girl and biracial (indian & italian) gay trans boy as main characters. \u2728cw: anxiety, alcoholism, (non-sexual) assault, injury, mentions of transphobia (v briefly and in the past)"}, {"userName": "Maddie (Heart Full Of Books)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18523225-maddie-heart-full-of-books", "userReview": "Thoughts to come closer to the release date!"}, {"userName": "Alice-Elizabeth (marriedtobooks)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45911840-alice-elizabeth-marriedtobooks", "userReview": "This is my first read by Alice Oseman and I really enjoyed it overall!

Both Angel and Jimmy's paths cross after an incident at the meet and greet.It was an interesting contemporary read, I did find it enjoyable reading from both perspectives. I liked the writing style, the dialogue was written well. There was a scene near the end that was a little bit scary and may be triggering.

Alice Oseman makes us meet with a Muslim teenage girl, a Christian gay trans boy, a black straight guy and two bisexual characters (boy and girl). I particularly liked the fact that the bisexual characters were not represented as sex addicts. There\u2019s always this stereotype of bi people having sex with everyone, or cheating their partners. Not here. I also adored how the author brings the topic of mental health. Indeed, Jimmy suffers from very strong social anxiety and paranoia. It was absolutely well written, even more through this world of fame where celebrities are targets and don\u2019t own their life anymore.\u2014 the topic of medias. Of course we already know that what we read in the medias is not always true. But we always believe it anyway, because that\u2019s our own source of information. This book shows that we don\u2019t know nothing at all. Having the points of view of Jimmy and Angel at the same time get to see how things can be hidden from the world. Jimmy is not happy, but the fans see his smile and think \u00ab\u00a0Gosh, look how happy he is ! \u00bb. They don\u2019t know that this same guy suffers from anxiety and paranoia and spent last night crying and wanting to hurt himself.\u2014 the fandom. As a professional fangirl, I somehow recognized myself in Angel, even though I don\u2019t have her level of fangirlism lmao. Actually, I liked that the fandom had \u00ab\u00a0good\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0bad\u00a0\u00bb effects at the same time. The author shows that the fans can be very supportive, that they can love and help people they only know through a screen. They\u2019re not just stupid teenage girls crying and fainting in front of their favorite singers. But on the other hand\u2026 Alice Oseman tells us that fandom can often take too much place in the life of someone. Angel is a true fan, but her entire world turns around people who don\u2019t even know she exists. And it\u2019s not good. She has to care about herself, care about her achievements and be proud of her before being ready to take a bullet for people she doesn\u2019t know. Sometimes, fans are just \u00ab\u00a0too much\u00a0\u00bb for celebrities. I really felt bad for The Ark, who just want to make good music and live like normal people.\u2014 the characters. I loved Angel, even though she was a bit too much sometimes. I felt close to her for meeting her internet best friend and wanting to talk about The Ark all day. But I mostly felt close to Jimmy, this lost boy who just wants to feel free again. My baby\u2026 <3 I also loved Lister, because he\u2019s an alcoholic kid who SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME. Don\u2019t do that again, I swear.\u2014 the end. I cried like hell at a certain chapter because I wasn\u2019t expecting this. But the end is open, so that every reader can imagine what happens to the characters.\u2014 the references to Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

This hadn\u2019t influenced my rating or review in any way.This is the most lovely book I\u2019ve read in a while, it\u2019s also the first book written by Alice Oseman that I\u2019ve ever read and it really didn\u2019t disappoint. Which is a huge thing considering how huge my expectations were!First of all, I want to applaud the amount of research that went into this book in order to write those amazingly diverse characters in a very authentic way. It was flawless.The female protagonist, Angel, is muslim, while the male protagonist, Jimmy is mixed race, trans and gay. Rowan is Nigerian. Lister (the cutest boy ever) is bi and also struggles with alcoholism.There were so many things being tackled in I Was Born For This, for example the stereotype that bisexuals sleep with everyone, which was slammed (thankfully) in a grand way here.Let me tell you a bit about the characters and the plot. Angel and Juliet are huge fans of The Ark, a band formed by Jimmy, Rowan and Lister. They\u2019ve been talking online for a long time when Angel finally decides to go to The Ark\u2019s concert in London, therefore spending the week at Juliet\u2019s. I Was Born For This gives you the possibility to glance into the world of the fans as well as the world of the celebrities. This was one of my favourite parts of the book, probably, because of how different some events were perceived by the fandom and the guys in the band and you got to see both perspectives. It was amazing.I loved how friendship and fandom were the main focus of this book, I adored every interaction between the characters, I loved how Oseman brought everyone together and how it all felt so natural despite the strange circumstances in which they met.Angel and Juliet\u2019s friendship was so complex, I felt like everything about them was so relatable. I\u2019ve had many virtual friends and I\u2019ve always had so many questions about how it would be to meet them in real life. What if it doesn\u2019t turn out as amazing as I hope? What if they are different from their online persona? I found all those questions in the book and so many more. Despite some of their conflicts, Angel and Juliet managed to sort out things and become even closer and that\u2019s such a great thing to read about when our society tries to undermine the \u2018depth\u2019 of virtual friendships left and right.The band and their bond was so unique. I loved the themes in their album, Alice Oseman was so careful at every detail, which made me so much more interested in everything! I think I would have stanned The Ark if it were a real band.Also, there is barely any romance in this book (yay!), but there were some mentions and I was shipping it, okay, I\u2019m shipping the hell out of it because my babies are too pure. I want a novella, can I get a novella? I know I might never get it, but one can only hope.I Was Born For This is a love letter to the fandom, but it\u2019s also a nudge to the rather aggressive and obsessed part of the fandom to try to be better and understand that celebrities are also humans.I would absolutely recommend this book, you\u2019re going to have a hard time putting it down once you start reading!You can check my blog post here"}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43823788-audrey", "userReview": "(4.5) wow! this definitely got me out of my reading slump (thank god). this was real and the characters were all so relatable and the story really captivated me. i liked this one even more than radio silence. alice oseman has a way of writing such incredible characters that at the same time that they make me say \u201cthis is so relatable tbh\u201d i want to protect them as if they\u2019re my own children. so yeah. good stuff!"}], "description": "For Angel Rahimi, life is only about one thing: The Ark \u2013 a pop-rock trio of teenage boys who are currently taking the world by storm.
