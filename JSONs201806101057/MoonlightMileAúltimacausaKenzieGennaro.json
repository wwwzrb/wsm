But what does the Russian mob have to do with Amanda's disappearance? And has she really been kidnapped?Moonlight Mile was Dennis Lehane's return to Kenzie and Gennaro, or are they Kenzie and Kenzie now, after a long absence. While Patrick and Angela may have lost a step or two after their domestication, I don't think Lehane has.Moonlight Mile starts simply enough. Amanda McCready, now sixteen, has disappeared once again, and Patrick can't stay away, bent on redemption after Gone, Baby, Gone. I missed Devin and Oscar but it was good to see Patrick, Angie, and Bubba again. Also, Gabby was a nice addition. The case had more than enough wrinkles to keep me occupied until the end. Some of the twists, like the switcheroo at the beginning, were predictable. Others not so much.Lehane's writing continue to impress me. I suppose I'll be picking up some of his non-series books pretty soon.I don't really have a lot more to say about this one. It was pretty typical for a Kenzie and Gennaro book, even with their young daughter Gabby involved. It seems like it will be the last one and I'd say it's a fitting swan song. I'd rather Patrick and Angela not wreck the domestic bliss they have going."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "If Dennis Lehane would have ripped off Charles Dickens and started this novel with \u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\u201d it would have been fitting.It\u2019s been eleven years since Lehane seemingly left his detective series starring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro behind to do stand-alone novels and work on HBO\u2019s The Wire. The last decade has been both good and bad to the couple. The economic collapse has hit them hard, and Patrick has been forced to do free-lance work for a large investigation firm that has him doing the bidding of various rich asshats. But if their professional lives aren\u2019t great, at least things are going well on the domestic front except for worrying about how they\u2019ll pay the bills.In the midst of their economic crisis, an old case comes back to haunt them. In Gone Baby Gone, Patrick and Angie went looking for missing four year old Amanda, and by the end of it, they faced some of the toughest decisions of their lives. Now they\u2019re going to have to deal with the consequences of those choices.(That\u2019s all the summary I\u2019m going to give, and I\u2019d caution anyone interested in this book to not read any kind of plot synopsis of this unless you\u2019ve read Gone Baby Gone  or seen the movie. Even the book flap for Moonlight Mile gives away a big piece of that ending. You have been warned.)It felt incredibly good to be reading a new Patrick and Angie story, and Lehane used some of the work he\u2019s done since to build a richer and deeper story for the pair. The influence of his time on The Wire shows in that one of the biggest villains in this book is a depressed economy. Lehane makes some poignant points about financial desperation and how it impacts everyone in a variety of ways.This backdrop also fits an aging and moodier Patrick. Twenty years as a detective have taken their toll, and he\u2019s increasingly disgusted with all the large and small ways that people can screw each other over. This reads as a swan song for Patrick and Angie, and it\u2019s pretty damn good. Not perfect. I\u2019d have liked more Angie in the story, but there are reasons she doesn\u2019t get more of the action this time. If this is the final book, then Lehane wrote a tender and touching farewell to Patrick and Angie that gives a satisfying ending to their series.Oh, and just in case you\u2019re worried that it\u2019s all social commentary and brooding about regrets, Bubba is still around. And he still gets all the best lines like, \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you just for being short.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "Dennis Lehane returns to the world of Boston PIs Patrick Kenzie and his partner, now wife, Angie Gennaro. He returns also to themes of parents and children that informed the five-book series Lehane produced in the 1990s. In Moonlight Mile, Patrick and Angie are themselves parents. Patrick is still working as a PI, struggling with some moral conflicts in his assignments from a prestigious law firm, while Angie is trying to find some sanity in non-life-threatening work. But when the aunt of a child he had recovered in the book Gone, Baby, Gone, turns up and asks Patrick to find her missing niece, now 16, one more time, we are back in familiar territory. It may be 11 years since the last Kenzie-Gennaro outing, but it feels like it was only last year. The dialogue still races along, offering the occasional laugh-out-loud moment. A few characters from the earlier novels assume their usual positions, but instead of corrupt cops this time we have Mordavian gangsters. There is enough substance abuse here to light up the western world. And although most of the children here are not overtly abused, how children are treated by systems, legal and not, comes in for yet another Lehane drive-by. Those on high are offered comparable treatment. His low view of humanity overall is clear, as one does not need to have a badge or tote automatic weapons to be a really, really awful human being in this snark-noir Boston. Fast-paced, engaging, with a hero who tries to do the right thing, and more importantly thinks about what the right thing is, payload in the form of a look at some of the dark side, high and low, this is commercial Lehane on cruise control. No one will mistake Moonlight Mile for Mystic River, Lehane\u2019s masterpiece, or The Given Day, his most ambitious work, but it will entertain, occasionally make you laugh, and shed some light into a dark corner or two. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal, Twitter and FB pagesOther books by Lehane I have read/reviewedThe Coughlin Series-----The Given Day-----Live by Night-----World Gone ByKenzie and Gennaro-----A Drink Before War-----Darkness, Take My Hand-----Sacred-----Gone, Baby Gone-----Prayers for RainRead, but not Reviewed-----Mystic River - a masterpiece-----Shutter Island - not"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Lehane, that guy can write!I'm climbing on to the Dennis Lehane bandwagon really late, but I am fully on board! Even though Moonlight Mile wasn't ragingly exciting, it's so well-crafted I couldn't put down this story of a Boston-area private detective who gets into new trouble because of an old case. This PI's career is coming to an end, but he doesn't know it yet. Russians, wunderkind and drug freaks all get the poor, aging family man deeper into the shit than he realizes he's about to fall into.Just like me! I didn't know I was getting into a series and that it was the last book! It wasn't a problem. I could tell these were people with a past, but I was never overwhelmed by my ignorance. This is the second jump-into-the-middle-of-a-Lehane-series I've done and in both cases the author does a fine job of giving enough detail to keep the reader abreast of the haps. In other words, the books are self-contained.I could see others giving this perhaps only 3 stars. It does drag with the chit chat here and there. I don't know, perhaps I've given this an extra star because it artificially kept my interest at times due to the setting being New England-based, which is where I grew up.

And by the tone of this book, I would say that Lehane has written the last book about the couple. Yes, I know Patrick shows up in FaceOff, but that story takes place before this story and is a short story. I found it quite suitable that the last book is a kind of continuation for Gone, Baby, Gone with Patrick and Angie once again trying to find Amanda McCready who once again is missing. It\u2019s been twelve years since they found her and brought her back home, a right thing to do according to the law. But was it the right thing to do for Amanda? Hardly! But she is doing ok; she has great grades despite that her mother is still a worthless drunk. So where is she? Once again is it Amanda\u2019s aunt that reaches out to Patrick and Angie to find her. This is a good ending to the series. You can feel it reading in the book that both Patrick and Angie are sick and tired of the life they have lived. Patrick is the only one still working as a detective, Angie is studying and they are now married with a daughter. This is really the last case they work together. The case in the book was a bit weak I think. I like it when Lehane turns everything upside down, sure surprising things happens, but not the shocking kind of surprises. More the kind that makes you go \u201cOh that makes sense,\u201d not the \u201cwtf what just happened?\u201d I prefer Lehane when he just pulls the rug from under one's feet, several times during a book.But it was still a good book. And even though I will miss them I think that Lehane has written a good ending to Patrick and Angie. I hope they will have a great fictional life together."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "At the beginning of his writing career, Dennis Lehane wrote an excellent series of gritty P.I. novels set in Boston and featuring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, detectives who operated out of an office in a church bell tower. The 1998 entry was Gone, Baby, Gone, in which the detectives mounted a long search for a missing four-year-old girl named Amanda McCready. The girl had been kidnapped from an abusive mother and a generally miserable home environment and left in the care of a stable, middle class couple who loved Amanda and provided her with an excellent home. Once having found Amanda, Patrick and Angie disagreed about whether they should return the girl to her awful mother or leave her in the home of the people who were obviously much better prepared to care for her. Ultimately, they returned Amanda to her biological mother, but the decision to do so drove a wedge into the relationship between the two detectives.Lehane would write one more Kenzie/Gennaro book, Prayers for Rain, published in 1999, before leaving the series to write a number of stand-alones, including Mystic River and Shutter Island. He now returns to the series with Moonlight Mile, a book that Kenzie/Gennaro fans have long awaited.Much has changed in the eleven years that have elapsed. Patrick and Angie are now married and the parents of their own four-year-old daughter. (This gives nothing away. It's in the promotional material and is revealed in the opening of the book.) Patrick is still working as a P.I., but the cases are few and far between. Angie has gone back to school and the family is struggling financially, victims of the recession. The office in the bell tower is gone--a casualty of the Catholic church's financial crisis--and now Amanda McCready has gone missing again.The case has haunted Patrick and Angie for twelve years and Patrick agrees to take the case and try to find Amanda for a second time. The hunt takes Patrick and Angie into a tangled world of Russian mobsters, irresponsible parents, and a young woman who is wise way beyond her years. In addition to the intellectual and physical challenges that the case poses for Patrick, he faces a number of ethical and moral dilemmas that are not easily resolved.This is a very good book--both highly entertaining and thought-provoking. But as a long-time fan who has read this series from the very beginning, I had a couple of quibbles. First, I regret, to some extent, the fact that Lehane simply picked up the series eleven years down the road. Major changes have occurred in the lives of characters that fans of the series have come to care about. And I feel somewhat cheated by the fact that I didn't get to watch those changes as they happened. It would be as if Lawrence Block had simply skipped over the book in which Matthew Scudder stopped drinking and became sober.My other concern is that Patrick makes choices in this book that would have been perfectly logical for a single detective in his early thirties, possessed of a strong moral code. Patrick still has a strong moral code, but I'm not sure that some of his choices are appropriate for a man with a wife and child who may well be seriously affected by those choices. He has other people to think about now, and I found myself questioning the logic of his actions at a couple of points.Those admittedly minor reservations aside, I enjoyed this book very much and it was great to finally see Patrick and Angie back again."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "[You could tell from the thin threads of plot that the entire plot line would sputter, and end up nowhere.

The plot developments in that book heavily influence what is going on in this book.To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone new to Lehane\u2019s work to this one. Whilst it\u2019s a good read it\u2019s not his best and is probably the weakest of the 6 Kenzie and Genaro novels. This is no bad thing mind; I\u2019d much rather read a below-par Lehane than some people on their finest form.There has been roughly a decade between the publication of the last novel and this one and things have changed with Kenzie and Genaro as is expected over such a period of time. The major impact has been the failing economy and how it has hit the couple hard meaning they are scraping to make ends meet and having to pursue other ventures as supposed to sleuthing. This added another level not seen in the other books, a certain desperation to all people involved and a driving factor for some of the actions taking by all parties on both sides of the fence.The introduction of Yefim was disappointing in that I wish he\u2019d have turned up at the start of the series and being in all the books! He was a great addition to this story and there were some humorous moments between Yefim and Kenzie. Also a mention to Bubba, always great and always a pleasure to read about him. Maybe there could be a Yefim and Bubba spin off. I\u2019ll see if I can pitch something to Lehane\u2019s people....I have to tip my hat to Lehane. This was a fine send off for the couple that he has well and truly put through the ringer over the years. I can\u2019t see there being another in this series but if there is it will be welcomed by me. All in all not his finest in the series and not a great standalone novel but a good read and a solid close to the series.

A dozen years after Gone, Baby, Gone, Amanda has gone missing again & the past is dredged up again, but with twists tied by a master. Lehane addresses some tough issues & they certainly made me think. I didn't come to any conclusions, though. It sucks to do the right, legal thing & still be wrong. This hit home hard because I've raised 3 kids & had a few that hung around because our house was a better home than they had. The kids were older, in high school, but I've covered some of this ground already in real life. If I've come to any conclusions about parenting is that no matter how hard I tried, I never got it right. Still, the kids turned out pretty well.Like I said, depressing. Still, it was a great story & too realistic to truly be a fun escape. I wouldn't have missed it, though."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "After shelving Kenzie and Gennaro for eleven years, Lehane returned to his signature characters in 2010 with the series\u2019 sixth novel, Moonlight Mile. A lot has happened since we last left the detectives. Patrick and Angie have since tied the knot and brought life into the world in their four year old daughter, Gabby. Feeling the pinch of the recession, Patrick is stuck freelancing for a big investigation firm, hoping to woo them enough to be hired on fulltime while Angie is taking classes working toward a degree.Patrick is approached by Beatrice McCready, the estranged aunt of the once missing Amanda McCready - the same Amanda that Patrick and Angie worked hard to track down twelve years ago (1998s Gone, Baby, Gone). Bea tells Patrick that Amanda, now 16, has gone missing a second time and once again requests Patrick\u2019s assistance in finding her. While initially reluctant, Patrick views this as his shot at redemption as he looks to ease the guilt over the results of the last time she went missing.Revisiting Kenzie & Gennaro\u2019s most famous case was likely the right move on Lehane\u2019s part in resurrecting the series. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I know I was curious as to what happened to little Amanda McCready and in Moonlight Mile, Lehane is determined to put her through the ringer one last time. While the plot isn\u2019t quite as complex as Gone, Baby, Gone, Lehane keeps things interesting by introducing a plethora of bit characters that populate some memorable scenes. Russian gangsters Pavel and Yefim stole every scene they were in - so much so that I\u2019d read the hell out of a book featuring just those two. Lehane somehow made Amanda\u2019s mother Helene even more despicable this time around and Patrick & Angie\u2019s encounter with a fitness guru yields some laughs, if only due to the man\u2019s missing moral compass.If this is where Lehane chooses to end the series, it\u2019s difficult to come up with any complaints. While life doesn\u2019t often give us happy endings, it\u2019s nice to know that once in awhile, the truly good people out there do get what they deserve in the end."}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859453-arah-lynda", "userReview": "So I picked this up at my local superstore.

This is my first \"Patrick and Angie\" book, and I was thoroughly disappointed by it.This novel appears to have been written primarily as a screenplay, one that panders to a fist-in-the-air high-five PC audience. If you removed all the unnecessary filler of political references, you could probably cut out 40 pages. (I agree with many of the references, but I don't agree that they belong in this book). It was overt and pandering distraction.The characters are straight out of cardboard central and are either implausible or ludicrously precious. I don't believe any adolescent from Southie uses the word \"arcane\" or rolls the words \"Solntsevskaya Bratva\" off her tongue. But just because Lehane spends a lot of exposition time telling us that this girl, Amanda, has a blazing intelligence does not back up the incongruous profile he has created. Her diction reflects a mature, older woman, an academic or maybe a senator. No matter how smart she is, her diction and vernacular are going to reflect her turf, age, and home influences. I don't believe she would speak like a dissertation candidate at Oxford. Additionally, Patrick and Angie are nothing short of adorably cuddly and the Russians are meretricious stereotypes.Ironically, Lehane inserts his moral compass, to the point of intrusion, on a regular basis. But somehow I missed his righteousness paired with a morally abhorrent assassin playing \"uncle\" to Patrick and Angie's toddler daughter. It is supposed to be charming and cute, especially when Bubba gets a love interest. He strikes me as a sociopath who I wouldn't let near any member of my family. That kind of manipulation in books and movies goes beyond gratuitous. The thing is, if this had been an Adam Sandler comedy, I would have accepted it. But, other than the twee and self-consciously clever banter, he took himself and this book rather seriously.The cringe factor of this story is too much. Is this what popular fiction is these days? I used to think Lehane was a cut above John Grisham and Dan Brown.I am from Boston, and enjoyed the rich sense of place he created in Mystic River. I did get a trickle of it occasionally in this book, but not enough to offset this ingratiating mess of a straight-to-Hollywood story."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36549125-william", "userReview": "The final Kenzie and Genarro book is very good, don't be afraid to read it.

However, that flaw does allow Lehane to continue to explore \"parent-child\" bonding and trauma. This theme appears in most of Lehane's books.

He was promoting Live by Night, which sounded very interesting, but wasn't out yet. So not wanting to leave empty handed, I wanted to pick up a book of his. There were copies of Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone, but I had seen the movie adaptations of both of those books. Then I saw this book, and remembering how unsettled I was at the end of Gone, Baby, Gone, I figured its sequel was a great place to start. Of course this is the sixth book about Kenzie and Gennaro, and that was the fourth, but what the hell, I didn't know that while I was standing at the table of his books.So I started this never having read Lehane, but having seen two of his movies, and having seen him on Castle as one of the fictional author's poker buddies. The first thing that struck me was how true everything rang. Some authors have a knack for dialogue, others for setting or mood, etc., but everything in Moonlight Mile rang true, from the way Kenzie and Gennaro's four-year-old talked, to the impact the recession was having on their blue-collar family. For example, at one point when discussing their lack of finances, Angie says the line \"then we'll eat soup.\" It's off-the-cuff and has no bearing on the plot or mystery, but I felt it their fictional struggle so hard right there I almost cried, and I can't remember the last time any book made me cry. The only negative I have for this book is that its blue-collar struggle theme, mood and tone is so real and powerful, it may be best to read whenever this country is in an up market, and not struggling through a recession."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I revisited Gone, Baby, Gone before reading this one, and I'm glad I did. All the particulars were fresh in my mind, so Moonlight Mile was just a continuation of the story for me, with no confusion. It's been 12 years, and everybody's wondering what ever became of Kenzie and Gennaro after they found four-year-old Amanda McCready. They're now Kenzie and Kenzie, middle-aged, with a four-year-old girl of their own. Amanda McCready is now almost 17, and she's missing again. Patrick Kenzie is still haunted by the choice he made in 1998 to return Amanda to her unfit mother, so he can't turn down the request to find Amanda again and do right by her.Moonlight Mile is Lehane Light. There's a lot less detail than in the early Kenzie and Gennaro novels, but that's not a bad thing. Some of those old ones dragged a bit, whereas Moonlight Mile makes a mad dash to each new revelation. While the mystery may be a little transparent and too easily resolved, the story buzzes with chuckle-worthy dialogue and some painfully accurate observations about the current woes of our society. It was fun to reconnect with the old characters---Patrick, Angie, Bubba---and see how the years have worn down some of their sharp edges and changed their priorities and perspectives. There are some holes in the plot. The way they figured out where Amanda had gone was totally lame. Amanda herself is not entirely believable as a 17-year-old girl. She's far too articulate and quick with analysis for one so young. And then there's the matter of the foreign characters speaking to each other in poor English for the benefit of the English-speaking characters (and readers). Not very realistic. These discrepancies and implausibilities are best overlooked as the plot hums along nicely. It's worth the ride just to see how everything untangles in the end and the characters make life-changing decisions. (Some of them also make life-ENDING decisions, but I'll say no more about that.)"}, {"userName": "Dan Trudeau", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1636711-dan-trudeau", "userReview": "Upon reading reactions to this book on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that I'm a different type of Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro fan than most. While I've always enjoyed the series, it sometimes gets a bit too cartoony for my taste. By that I mean the mysteries often go a step or two past plausible. While that's perfectly fine for other writers, I always hoped for more from the writer of Mystic River. Also, I'll just come right out and say I don't love Bubba as a character. He's a bit too over the top, even compared with the heavies from other mystery series, like Mouse from the Easy Rawlins books (the gold standard).So what do I like about these novels? It comes down to the level of affection I have for Patrick and Angie. If they were real people, I'd want them to be my friends. I care about their lives, I care about their relationship, and I care that they make it out of each book okay. Because of all these things, I enjoyed this book a whole lot more than others I'm reading comments by. They complain that Bubba is underused. That's fine by me. The mystery is more mundane than they like. Again, I'm perfectly happy with that. In fact, this being a direct sequel to my favorite book in the series (Gone, Baby, Gone) makes me even happier. The choices Patrick and Angie made in that book were the type where you don't just move on past them. The consequences linger for years and it was great that Lehane used this as a way to give the series a climax.So this book engaged me from beginning to end. I ripped through it in no time as I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I'm also more than satisfied with where the characters are at in the end.

I love those books. They're real, raw, dark, and unflinching. To read him trashing them as crap was a blow and really offensive as a reader. Apparently he got the point and lo and behold, a new Patrick & Angie book!For the most part I liked it. It was interesting that he went back to the characters from Gone, Baby, Gone. I don't find that to be the strongest of these books but by the end of this current one I realized why he'd done it.He still can absolutely take your breath away with a single sentence, a thought Patrick throws out that just smacks you silly with its brutal honesty and simplicity. I love that about his writing. Patrick, pardon my language, was a bit of a douche in the beginning of the book but grows back into himself while it progresses.I wish I could say the same about Angie. She was a strong, intelligent, take no shit kind of woman in all of the books - the movie made her weak, which I hated about it. In this book, she's just taking up space. He doesn't even utilize Bubba. He's more of an afterthought.By the end of the book it is screamingly obvious that the only reason Lehane wrote this was to truly end the Patrick & Angie line. It wasn't about growth, it wasn't about \"12 years later\", about how everyone had changed - it was a simple, \"There, it's written, it's done, shut up and move on\" and that doesn't sit well with me."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/945939-kathryn", "userReview": "A weak follow-up to the fantastic Gone Baby Gone. I've been waiting for over 10 years to learn Amanda McCready's fate, so I jumped at the sequel which has the now 16-year old Amanda disappearing for a second time with Kenzie once again employed to track her down. The premise sounds amazing, but the plot's thin and predictable. Lehane, who generally specializes in creating memorable characters, failed to do so here. New characters were either generic or one-dimensional. There were traces of the wit found in other Lehane novels, and that, combined with return of Kenzie, Gennaro, and Bubba, were the only shining beacons in an otherwise subpar novel. It seems like Lehane might have be in a rush to complete the novel or was feeling pressure from his publishing company.

When he was able to found her, he was faced with a decision of following the law or returned the child to an unfit mother. Patrick decided to do the first; a decision that resulted in a big break up between him and her-girlfriend then, Angela Genarro. Now, twelve years later, Amanda is once again missing, and Patrick is on the trail. Truth be told, almost all of Dennis Lehane's novels have this certain darkness with them. This one though, feels a bit lighter and not as gripping as the others. I love Patrick and Angie -- but this novel features Patrick and Angie that have aged (they're now in early 40's). They are not the same people that I last read back in 2000. They are married and have a daughter of their own. Life is not just the two of them -- they have a new responsibility. They must deal with the recent failing economy: struggle to pay the bills, to provide food on the table. Patrick is the sole breadwinner for the family because Angie is getting her Master's Degree and he is the one who needs to provide the money. So, this is a different Patrick for me. To be perfectly honest, I miss his edge. He is still sarcastic but he seems ... tired almost apathetic. Dennis Lehane's Gone, Baby, Gone is one of those novels whose ending stay with me for a long time. One, that I'm not sure even until now, where I'm completely agree on how the case solved. In this novel, 12 years later, I think that one case still becomes the \"ghost\" in Patrick Kenzie's life -- he is certain that his decision back then is right but at the same time he is totally wrong. So when he takes the case, I have a feeling that he wants to make amends to the life of people affected by it. There are some moral debate about child welfare in here, when Patrick and Amanda discuss his decision back then. There are also a bit preaching of other issues. On one hand, I am disappointed. The case is solved in slighly comical/over-the-top way which screams Hollywood screw-ball action/comedy writings. It doesn't feel like a Dennis Lehane's ending. On the other hand, Dennis Lehane still writes amazingly. The story is fast-paced and easy to follow. Patrick and Angie have that quirk relationship that so endearing. Plus, Patrick still holds that sarcasm which makes me giggling with empathy. Check the dialog below ...\u201cWhat about her friend, Sophie?\u201d I asked. \u201cEwww!\u201d \u201cThat daggy bee-atch?\u201d \u201cThat chick was wannabe-dot-com.\u201d \u201cDot-org.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d \u201cI heard she, like, tried to list you as her friend on her Face-book page.\u201d \u201cEwww!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d After my daughter was born, I\u2019d considered buying a shotgun to ward off potential suitors fourteen or so years up the road. Now, as I listened to these girls babble and imagined Gabby one day talking with the same banality and ignorance of the English language, I thought of buying the same shotgun to blow my own fucking head off. I guess, it's a nice way of saying goodbye to Patrick and Angie -- knowing that they are now living their life like most of middle calss Americans, with their daughter (who charms me even if she does not appears in every page), trying to make ends meet without bringing danger and death into their household. For that, I wish them well, and I must thank Mr. Lehane for giving us the chance to do so."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1883816-barbara", "userReview": "Dennis Lehane has always attracted me with his writing. As usual, I enjoyed reading this fast paced mystery novel,but it did not impress me as much as Mystic River. However he provided some good insights into human behavior,including morals and choices one makes for a lifetime. Lehane's characters rang true, especially old favorites, Kenzie and Gennaro and now their little daughter,Gabby. Gone, Baby, Gone , another of my admired tales by this author, was recalled with the return of the star characters. It was a pleasure to be immersed in their familiar Massachusetts territory again, and picture the well-described scenery which I know so well. *********************************************************************I am including this brief note as an addition to my previous comments because a recent discussion of this book has encouraged me to give it more thought. My rating is a generous choice, especially in comparison to Lehane's other novels, but his style continues to capture my interest.

The two are Boston private eyes \u2013 a dynamic duo of sorts \u2013 tackling morally complex cases and fighting the good fight against evil-doers in their beloved city \u2013 all the while balancing a relationship that evolves from being \u201cjust friends\u201d to much more than \u201cpartners.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read the Kenzie/Gennaro books, start with A Drink Before The War and read this series in chronological order. You will not be disappointed. In Moonlight Mile, Patrick and Angie are now married and the parents of a four year old girl. The two are trying to make financial ends meet; Patrick free-lancing with an eye on a full-time gig with a \u201csecurity firm\u201d; Angie attending night school in the hopes of pursuing a more stable - and safer \u2013 career. Adulthood and its responsibilities have caught up with our two heroes and although they\u2019re squawking, for their daughter\u2019s sake, they are making a concerted effort to \u201cgrow up\u201d.This book \u2013 the pair\u2019s sixth adventure - follows A Prayer For Rain, but is actually a sequel to Gone, Baby, Gone, the fourth book in the series. In that book the two were hired to find a kidnapped girl, Amanda McCready - coincidentally 4 years old at that time \u2013 the conclusion was messy and a true defining moment for Patrick and Angie. So much so I thought briefly that the book might be the conclusion of the series.Now, 12 years later, teenaged Amanda has gone missing again and Patrick is \u201chired\u201d by her aunt \u2013 the same concerned McCready relative from Gone, Baby, Gone - to find her. With mixed emotions, detectives Mr. and Mrs. Kenzie take on the case, battle many of the unresolved issues of 12 years earlier and find themselves facing a new set of 21st century bad guys, including the Russian mafia. The story-line tiptoes up to the \u201csuspend belief\u201d line several times, but with a twist or a turn, Lehane saves Moonlight Mile from descending into farce.Reviews have been extremely mixed on this novel \u2013 my guess is because for all intents and purposes Moonlight Mile appears to be last Kenzie/Gennaro adventure \u2013 and fans do not want to let them go \u2013 myself included. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it a more than a fitting conclusion to an excellent series \u2013 so highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27580139-margaret", "userReview": "Decent story, nice read.

Like its five predecessors, Moonlight Mile features the quick wit and snappy back & forth between partner private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. Published eleven years after the fifth book in the series, though, this one features a more mature relationship between the two.Patrick and Angie are in their early forties now. Their minds and bodies have aged. They can\u2019t do what they used to do. They can\u2019t recover as quickly. Along with that, they take a more macroscopic view of the world around them. Still, they are who they are. Their principles have not changed, even if the manner in which they apply them has. Right and wrong mean different things than they used to.All in all, I found Moonlight Mile to be a fine conclusion to the series. It\u2019s not pretty. Nothing involving Patrick and Angie has ever been pretty, so it would have been disingenuous of Lehane to conclude their tale in any other way. Their lives are messy, complicated, dark, and filled with choices and sacrifices that would drive many people to a nonfunctioning level of mental instability. That does not change here.While each novel in the series stands on its own, I highly recommend reading all six novels in chronological order. At the very least, I believe one should read Gone,Baby, Gone before picking up Moonlight Mile. Reading this book before Gone,Baby, Gone will rob the reader of many of the emotions that I felt while I read this week.The primary plot of Moonlight Mile involves Kenzie and Gennaro trying, once again, to find Amanda McCready. The pair had found four-year old Amanda in Gone,Baby, Gone and returned her to her disinterested mother. In this final installment of the Kenzie-Gennaro series, Patrick and Angie learn that sixteen-year old Amanda has disappeared from her still disinterested mother. The first time they searched for Amanda, the detectives dealt with pedophiles and police. This time, they face Russian mobsters. And Amanda is no longer an innocent fragile little girl. Now she is fearless. And brilliant.Sixteen-year old Amanda is, in my opinion, the most fascinating character Lehane created throughout the series. She survived a hell of a childhood and grew into a completely self-aware and self-assure young woman. She is without a doubt the least distressed damsel that ever needed rescuing. Throughout the novel I felt as if Patrick and Angie were trying to rescue a rising serial killer. Amanda is, in my mind, a psychopath. But a sympathetic one. One I rooted for until the very last page.Unlike the first five novels, this one is not about Kenzie and Gennaro. Yes, they are the main characters and entire novel is told through Patrick\u2019s first-person narrative. But Moonlight Mile is all about Amanda, who she\u2019s become, what lies in her future, what created the person she became, and how she deals with the world.No matter what happens to Amanda, the tale can\u2019t help but to be sad. The events of Gone,Baby, Gone messed her up permanently. Those changes can never be undone. Amanda accepts them and works her way through them. Even in her psychosis, Amanda McCready is a heroic figure, and that is Moonlight Mile\u2019s greatest success.I was disappointed by the absence of Bubba. He only appeared for a couple of scenes, but none of them contained the Bubba that I\u2019d grown to love over the course of the first five books. I understand, though. As I said earlier, Patrick and Angie are older; they are more mature. Their lives are different. To a certain degree, they had graduated from Bubba\u2019s world.Another, greater, disappointment was the beginning. The first few chapters were slow. After all those years away from writing them, it seemed as if Lehane had to work his way back into his Kenzie-Gennaro comfort zone. Once we finally meet Angie, everything is fine and the rhythm is back. It just took a while to get there.Overall, I loved it. And if you like the series, I think you will like it, too."}, {"userName": "Harry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597429-harry", "userReview": "Though all my reviews for this series are the same, I would add a note on this, the last of the Kenzie & Gennaro series. Lehane does know how to wrap up a series properly, he does explore the full range of human emotions as they occur during the denouement. We get closure through reliving the past, understanding our history, and taking that to galvanize current forces to shape a new future. Kenzie & Gennaro are Gone, Baby, Gone. And it is fitting...------------------------------------Hmmmm...someone liked one of my reviews and I checked out this person's reading list as well as their reviews and heard mention somewhere in there a sentence or two about heroes, one likeable, the other...well, more along the lines of a sociopath. Dennis Lehane, among other authors was mentioned in this respect.As always, my curiosity was piqued, and although I checked out the other named authors I did finally settle on Dennis Lehane. It was a good decision. Perhaps one of the best reading decisions ever. Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro series is best described as being in the Noir series of detectives (I am reminded of Andrew Vacchs as another excellent member of this genre). This study of the darker side of humanity is epxressed through very witty and sometimes humerous dialogue that contrasts sharply with each novel's antagonists: awash in horrendous and pure evil. Lehane's descriptions are on the mark, there's no guessing as you attempt to imagine each scene described: you see it as it was meant to be seen. I've seen other novelists (Katherine Slaughter, for example) try to pull this off but frankly, the writing does not compare in both dialogue and descriptions. At least, not after you've read Lehane.As my other reviews attest, I'm interested in the lone hero in novels (series only, please), an interest awakened by the Jack Reacher novels of Lee Child and Coben's Myron Bolitar series as well as other excellent novelists (see my other reviews). In the Reacher novels, all aspects of the hero (consistent values, propensity for violence, temptation, etc.) are encased in a single hero: Jack Reacher. Harlan Coben splits these characteristics and infuses them into two heroes: Myron Bolitar (values and principles), and Win (our favorite sociopath). Lehane takes this a step further and presents us with a three way split from Jack Reacher: Gennaro (the good), Kenzie (the good mixed with propensity for violence), and Bubba (our favorite sociopath).When it comes to Noir, you can't get any better than Dennis Lehane. And if you're interested in this genre, do take the time to read the works of Andrew Vacchs (start at the beginning folks!). Outstanding in their own right and as good, if not better than Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro series.If you've read this review of the Kenzie and Gennaro books, than you've read them all. His work will keep you up late into the night, reading, when you should be sleeping and getting ready for work."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "11 years after Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro found Amanda McCready in \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" she's disappeared again! Russian mobsters are after her as Kenzie and Gennaro hit her trail as well as wannabe gangsters, but as they investigate Amanda's sad life in the years following her return to her biological drug addled abusive mother, a strange picture emerges of the person she became. And what does the riddle mean - five people went into a room, two people died, but four came out? I really enjoyed this novel, it's fast paced, well written, with some excellent characterisation. Dennis Lehane is a helluva writer who can write action better than some directors shoot it on film and the sequences involving the Russian mafia were exhilarating. He also picks up the tone of the two detectives perfectly from \"Gone Baby Gone\" almost as if it hadn't been 10 years since we'd seen the characters. I will say this though - it's not as good as \"Gone Baby Gone\" or \"Prayers for Rain\", the storyline isn't strong enough. Neither is it as good as his masterpiece \"Shutter Island\" or his excellent historical novel \"The Given Day\", but Lehane on slightly above average is still a great read. The story takes nearly 100 pages to get going and it's over by page 370, the pacing ensuring that you'll be finished with this novel in two, if not one, sittings and that's a definite plus. The only things that bothered me were the really syrupy lovey dovey nonsense between Kenzie and Gennaro - they're in love with each other, I get it, but does Lehane really have to go on about it? You'll know what I mean when you read it. Those passages aren't many but when they show up it undermines the gritty story and high quality of writing. And the ending... well I'm not 100% sure that's how Russian mobsters as sadistic as those portrayed in this novel would behave but who knows? It's not totally unrealistic but seems a bit unconvincing. Overall, excellent mystery thriller! Well written, some great characters, an intriguing storyline, and a fast pace in keeping with the genre. While it's not Kenzie and Gennaro's best outing, it's still a good novel and definitely good for several hours' entertainment.
