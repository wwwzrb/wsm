I've also viewed the war through the eyes of death. I thought this might be another side of how the war impacted people and changed their lives so I started this with high expectations. Ada Vaughn has dreams and aspirations of becoming a dress designer and having her own house of fashion some day . At first , I liked her ambition and enthusiasm. She leaves London in 1939 for Paris, with the war imminent. Ada ignores the warnings and is too naive at 19 to understand what is happening. She believes that Stanislaus loves her and will help her become who she wants to be . He turns out to be not exactly who he says he and in Paris her nightmare begins At first I felt sorry for her as she was young and naive and easily duped . But as the story progressed I really questioned some of her decisions. I didn't really connect with her on an emotional level until the end of the story . The thing is that I wanted that to have happened much earlier . I have to mention that I take exception to the comparison to Doerr. This was not anything like nor nearly as good as Doerr's book . I gave it 3 stars because I did eventually connect with Ada and was taken by the ending.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House and NetGalley for the advance copy of this book ."}, {"userName": "Marla Madison", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478259-marla-madison", "userReview": "I seldom award a book only one star because if they are that undeserving, I normally don't finish them. The Dressmaker's War, although well-written, had to be one of the most depressing tale's of a woman's life that I've ever read. I kept reading always hoping something would get better for Ada, a young woman who, at the very beginning of WWII, follows a ne'er do well boyfriend to Paris where she believes he is going to propose. Stanislaus, however, has other intentions and eventually dumps Ada in Belgium just as the war is starting. She is unable to get back to England to her family, ends up being hidden by a group of nuns who are taking car of the sick and dying for the Germans. Ada's life gets worse and worse. She has a baby who is born dead (Stanislaus's) and she believes to be alive after a priest smuggles the baby out of the convent. She ends up as a dressmaker for the Germans who treat her worse than an animal while piling work on her. Then, when she miraculously is saved and returns to England and the reader is hoping to see her take what she's learned from all that and improve her life, she continues to make stupid decisions all the way to one of the most depressing endings I've ever read. So, if you enjoy a book with a female character who constantly goes downhill, never learns from experience, and almost never has a positive moment, this is the book for you. Guaranteed not to make you smile or feel good about the world we live in."}, {"userName": "Irene\u25b3\u20d2\u20d8", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55991704-irene", "userReview": "1.5/5 \u301c ITA/ENG (NOW ADDED)\n  \u201cTi chiamano la sarta di Dachau. Sei sulla bocca di tutti. Da te viene la migliore societ\u00e0, gente influente, sai. Non solo di Dachau. Anche di Monaco, Berlino. Mi dicono che la voce \u00e8 giunta fino al F\u00fchrer.\u201d\nHo preso questo libro perch\u00e9 \u00e8 quello che mi sarei voluta aspettare dalla sua storia. Purtroppo invece il libro \u00e8 stato suddiviso male a mio parere, o il titolo non \u00e8 del tutto adeguato.Ada come protagonista e soprattutto come carattere non mi \u00e8 piaciuto per niente. Alla fine ho faticato parecchio per concludere la lettura perch\u00e9 veramente stava diventando snervante.Il libro ti d\u00e0 subito un\u2019idea ben chiara di come sia questa ragazza. E\u2019 tutta piena di s\u00e9 e vuole per forza \u201cdiventare qualcuno\u201d. Non \u00e8 sbagliato, sia chiaro, ma questo suo atteggiamento esce anche in situazioni del tutto inadeguate, mi spiego. Nonostante TUTTI le abbiano sconsigliato l\u2019inizio di questa sua avventura parigina - finita poi in disgrazia - lei parte ugualmente perch\u00e9 pensa di aver trovato l\u2019uomo della sua vita, ovvero finalmente qualcuno che la faccia diventare quello che lei vorrebbe, una sarta di successo. Purtroppo tutto l'insieme mi ha creato un disprezzo per il personaggio non indifferente e per questo il finale non mi ha toccata minimamente.L\u2019errore di dare sempre troppa confidenza o di farsi influenzare e ingannare cos\u00ec facilmente si ripete veramente di continuo che ti chiedi ad un certo punto se lo stia facendo apposta\u2026La parte della sua prigionia che doveva essere la parte principale del libro si riduce a forse un centinaio di pagine a farla grande.Le altre duecento sono dedicate alla vita prima e dopo la guerra, di come Ada ha un lavoro rispettoso e anche con delle soddisfazioni prima, e di come invece decider\u00e0 di affrontare il dopo. La storia in generale non mi \u00e8 piaciuta, come ho gi\u00e0 detto mi aspettavo il libro fosse molto pi\u00f9 incentrato sulla sua esperienza a Dachau, invece la sua storia fa da cornice per creare il finale.Per essere un libro nemmeno lungo perch\u00e9 \u00e8 sulle 300 pagine penso si prenda un spazio temporale troppo vasto, e tutto \u00e8 scritto in modo frettoloso e a saltoni.Si passa da un Natale ad una primavera con un semplice paragrafo, tra l'altro non ci sono capitoli. In breve, questo libro ha un gran bel potenziale per\u00f2 la storia \u00e8 sotto un certo punto di vista piuttosto ripetitiva, dove ci si deve sopportare in continuazione una ragazzina troppo sicura di s\u00e9 che commette in continuazione gli stessi stupidi errori, con una struttura molto sconclusionata e soprattutto un personaggio principale al limite del sopportabile. Lo stile di scrittura, invece, mi \u00e8 piaciuto parecchio, ed \u00e8 stato proprio grazie a lui che sono riuscita a concludere il libro, anche se alla fine mi sono ritrovata a saltare dei pezzi perch\u00e9 non ce la facevo pi\u00f9.______________________________I picked this book up because it\u2019s what I wanted to expect from its story. Unfortunately in my opinion the book is not well divided, or the title is a little misleading.Ada as a character but especially as a persona is awful. I really didn\u2019t like her at all. In the end I found it very hard to finish the book, it was getting too unnerved.The book gives you immediately an idea of how this girl is. She\u2019s so full of herself and she wants at all costs to \u201cbecome somebody\u201d. I really don\u2019t think that this is a bad thing, I want this to be clear, but you can see her act like that even in completely inappropriate situations, meaning: Even if EVERYONE told her not to leave for this Parisian escape - ended later in tragedy - she went anyway because she thought she had found the man of her life, someone that finally will help her be what she had always wanted, a popular and famous dressmaker. This had sadly made me hate her character so much, and thanks to this, I wasn\u2019t even a little touched by the finale.The massive mistake to keep giving trust and being influenced and fooled so easily is repeated way too much and at some point you start asking yourself is she\u2019s actually doing it on purpose\u2026The part where she is kept as a prisoner that I thought would actually be the main big part, is reduced at less like than one hundred pages.The other two hundreds are dedicated to her life before and after the war, where Ada has a respectable job with even some rewards before and how she decides how to live her life after.I didn\u2019t like the story in general, as I already said I expected the book to be more focused on her story and experience in Dachau, instead this story is like the frame for the finale. Despite the book not being that long because it\u2019s around 300 pages, we jump too much forward in time, everything is written in a rush and it\u2019s skipped a lot.We go through a Christmas to a Spring with simply a paragraph, there are no chapters in here in fact.In short, this book as a lot of potential, but the story is way too repetitive, where we have constantly to tolerate a childish girl too much self-assured that repeats every time the same stupid mistakes, with a pretty messy structure and especially a barely bearable main character.I liked a lot the writing style, on the contrary, and it was thanks to it that I was able to reach the end of this book even if I skipped some parts during the very last pages because I couldn\u2019t do it anymore."}, {"userName": "Dorie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this book through netgalley in exchange for an honest review. The copy of my book was titled \u201cThe Dressmakers War\u201d.I had not been requesting any books revolving around WWII since there has been a plethora of books written from almost every angle. This book however promised a new perspective.Ada Vaughn is a 19 y/o young woman recently moved to London from a small town with the hopes of becoming a dressmaker, perhaps having a shop of her own. She starts work as a modiste for a well known and highly regarded dressmaker and begins to model her own designs. She longs for the life of the women who purchase her clothes. Just as she is becoming known for her designs she is swept off of her feet by a foreigner who promises her the life she desires in Paris. She goes with him to Paris but when war breaks out he leaves her and escapes on his own. After being sheltered by nuns in a convent for some time, the nuns are forced to work in a hospital for Hitler\u2019s German soldiers and the infirm. From there she is forced to sew and design for a commandant\u2019s wife and her friends in a bare room with barely enough food to keep from starving and just enough blankets and fabric to keep her from freezing. She sews to save her life and she really knows nothing of what is really going on in Dachau. When Dachau is finally liberated she lands back in London only to find it completely changed by the bombings and even more poor than before the war. She once again falls prey to a man who promises to make her life better and she continues to dream of a dressmaking shop.Ada makes so many mistakes in judgement that I felt as though I wanted to warn her again and again not to trust the promises of men. It is a bit hard not to judge her decisions but the world was a very different place for a woman back then and she was very young when she was meant to endure almost inconceivable cruelty, tragedy and heartbreak. The author is a professor of history and the details of the war in both London and what is happening in Dachau are well described and gripping. The story moves at a quick pace and I found myself finishing it in just a few sittings. This is definitely a different view of the war, describing another kind of imprisonment by Hitler\u2019s army, one perhaps just as devastating.I would recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction, it is well written, tense, and enlightening."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura", "userReview": "Ava is young, ambitious and naive. She dreams of designing her own dresses and selling them to the upper class women of London. Luckily, she has a natural talent, and her life is pretty much mapped out. That is until she meets a charming and mysterious gentleman who whisks her away for a romantic break in Paris, where she can study French fashion and purchase materials for her collection. And then war breaks out.This was a brilliant read set among the dramatic and desolate times of the mid twentieth century. The reader joins Ava on her journey through wartime as she is faced with horrendous situations that require all her strength to survive. I had assumed she would be placed in a concentration camp, but I was mistaken. However, that doesn't mean she was never a prisoner. There is more than one type of war.I felt the author was very respectful in her approach to the difficulties women faced in wartime. Ava is flawed, but undeniably a good woman at heart. She didn't deserve what happens to her - the novel is breathtakingly sad at times. I would love the author to continue writing books of this genre; I was captivated until the last page."}, {"userName": "Maria Roxana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34443678-maria-roxana", "userReview": "O carte pentru care cuv\u00e2ntul \u201dtulbur\u0103tor\u201d \u00ee\u0219i pierde din semnifica\u021bie pentru c\u0103 revolta, nedreptatea cu care se confund\u0103 sufletul Adei se pierd \u00eentr-un c\u00e2rcel sufletesc atunci c\u00e2nd ajungi la finalul \u201dpove\u0219tii.\u201dR\u0103zboiul este de fapt o materializare a orgoliilor proste\u0219ti. \u00cen urma lui r\u0103m\u00e2n suflete schilodite, destine modificate \u0219i \u00eentreb\u0103ri cu \u201d de ce?\u201d la care nu exist\u0103 oricum r\u0103spuns.Recomand cu c\u0103ldur\u0103 aceast\u0103 minunat\u0103 carte!"}, {"userName": "Konstantin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60906430-konstantin", "userReview": "Celokupna kniga je za jednu i po zvezdicu jer je kao istorijska fikcija omanula, ali se prvih trista stranica i zadnjih pet razlikuju kao da ih nije pisala ista osoba.

As it turned out, going into it 'blind' was the best thing to do as it didn't go the way I assumed it would at all. Born in the backstreets of London, 18 year old seamstress Ada has dreams of opening her own fashion house one day. Naive and trusting yet ambitious, she meets the exotic Stanislaus, a meeting which will change her life forever but not in she way she hopes. He fills head with promises and sweeps her away to Paris, but when WWII breaks out they are unable to return home and are forced to flee to Namur in Belgium just before it falls to the Nazis...and that's pretty much all I'll say about the plot. I realise that's not much inducement, but not knowing what will happen to Ada during and after the war really is the way to go. I'll just add that despite Dachau being in the title, this isn't set in that camp although Ada can see its smoking chimneys from her barred window. I was completely engrossed with this story, and loved Ada. She makes mistakes which lead to her own personal hell, but it's not just her mistakes that lead her there; she isn't a strong feisty heroine who takes on the war and wins like many do in this genre, she's a normal, young, inexperienced girl who suffers horribly through war, who lives in a time where a woman's role and worth are very much secondary to a mans, and where mental health issues aren't even considered.

First off, I have to say that I actually liked the premise, its a different angle for a book about WWII and the Holocaust. By all accounts I should have loved this book but there are some issues. While Ada's naiveness was initially endearing, as the story progressed, I questioned her decisions to a point of frustration. There is no denying that Ada faced horrific circumstances but while she was like-able, it was tough to understand some of the choices she made, especially after the war was over. It was not til the last third of the novel that we see a more complete picture of who Ada is, that is when you begin to really feel for her.

Stranded in Belgium by a man Ada thought loved her, she took refuge in a convent until the Nazis rounded up the nuns and shipped them even further from Ada's home to care for wounded and ill Germans.This story had many elements to it, all of which gave an interesting perspective of World War II. The first part of the novel showed Ada as a naive idiot who had no reason to believe that Count Stanislaus was a Count or in love with her. Yet, she blindly followed him far from her home and stood by him even when he treated her poorly. I didn't like her character at all at that point, but began to respect her more once she started vocalizing her opinions and taking actions to keep herself alive.Ada's dress making skills were highlighted through the novel as she used her ability to earn a living and stay alive regardless of where she ended up. I especially liked that she was able to secure a somewhat protected position as the seamstress to a high ranking German woman whose husband ran the concentration camp at Dachau. With all her ingenuity, I felt the author really let Ada down when she turned her into a prostitute. I wasn't thrilled when the story led Ada to that low position and was confused by the trial at the end of the novel. That legal aspect didn't seem to fit in with the majority of the story spent on Ada's survival.This was a story with a lot of telling. Ada told us how she felt and told us what she was doing rather than feeling and doing. The writing was a little flat, which made this a slower read. This was an okay novel, but a little scattered and confusing when the author tried to include too many events into the story."}, {"userName": "Mairead Hearne (swirlandthread.com)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32272031-mairead-hearne-swirlandthread-com", "userReview": "\u2018You may look like a swan, but if you talk like a sparrow, who will take you seriously? Welcome, Miss Vaughan\u2019\nI was lucky enough to receive my copy of The Dressmaker of Dachau from Harper Collins. It is written by Mary Chamberlain and published in 2015 by The Borough Press, an imprint of Harper Collins.My review is as ever my own opinion and most importantly, an honest one. I do hope you enjoy.\u2018London, spring 1939. Ada Vaughan is a young and ambitious seamstress. Desperate to escape from her working-class home and blind to the warnings of war on the continent, she elopes with her lover to Paris.But when war is declared they become trapped. He abandons her, pregnant & vulnerable.Taken prisoner and sent to Germany as slave labour, Ada is forced to survive on her wits alone, using her dressmaking skills to win favour with her captors. It is a decision which will haunt her during the war and its devastating aftermath.\u2019The Dressmaker of Dachau has been on my horizon of books to read for quite some time. I guess the name struck a chord with me as I myself have an interest in sewing, my mother was a dressmaker and I just felt it was one of those books I wanted to read.In the book, Mary Chamberlain introduces us to Ada Vaughan. Brought up in the back streets of London, Ada is extremely ambitious. She is very lucky to get a position within a dressmaking establishment and quickly learns her trade. Ada dreams of Haute Couture and the Parisian Ateliers.\u2018Distinctive style. A signature, she thought, that\u2019s the word. Like Chanel. A signature, something that would mark out the House of Vaughan.\u2019Ada, ambitious to the extreme, is never short of admirers but she is quickly fooled by a \u2018gentleman\u2019 and departs for Paris with him just before war breaks out.Trapped in Paris, they make a run for Belgium. Ada, though slightly worried about her lover\u2019s state of mind, remains with him and completely puts her trust and faith in him. Alas, this is to be her downfall.Ada tries to hide and does receive limited protection from a convent but not enough. She is captured by German soldiers and so begins a journey for Ada that seemed so distant when she ran away to Paris.Ada is forced into slave labour in Dachau. Her saving grace is her ability to sew. She is imprisoned in the home of a high ranking official and established as a dressmaker to the women of the German officers.Ada, lives in a world of black and white. There is no colour, except for the fabric she gets to touch, to feel. She is treated like dirt, like an animal but she still produces beautiful garments and it isn\u2019t long before word spreads.\u2018This was slave labour, she knew \u2013 but at least she was sewing, was creating. A modiste. Perhaps when the war was over, if it was ever over, she\u2019d go to Paris again. She\u2019d have experience after all. She didn\u2019t have to say where she got it. House of Vaughan\u2026\u2026She must hope\u2026she wouldn\u2019t lose this.\u2019Ada\u2019s years in Dachau are tough. She survives thinking her ordeal is over. She expects to return to the bosom of her family in London. But for Ada, her war isn\u2019t over yet.The Dressmaker of Dachau will tear at your heartstrings. Mary Chamberlain depicts Ada beautifully. She is a young girl with hopes and dreams. The future is something she sees for herself as clear as day. She belongs in Paris and that is where she will be.The war has a detrimental effect on Ada\u2019s dreams, as it did on many a person at the time. Mary Chamberlain\u2019s description of the direction Ada\u2019s life takes after her return is portrayed with such realism, it is heartbreaking.I would definitely recommend this book for any fan of historical fiction. It is a truly beautiful read and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.M xxAbout the Author:Mary Chamberlain has lived and worked in England and the Caribbean, and is Emeritus Professor of History at Oxford Brookes University.Her book, Fenwomen, was the first to be published by Virago Press in 1975.

This is not the kind of story that needs a \"wannabe sexy\" super breathy voice, which is how the narrator started this book. I admit that I was ready to return the book at 40 minutes, but decided to sleep on it, and see how I felt in the morning. I listened to it all the way thru, and the narrator did eventually lose that extreme breathiness, but they really should have gotten someone else to read this book. I am going to think very hard before purchasing another book with this narrator.As for the story, the writing is very good. I liked the story, up to a point. Not sure why I insist on reading or listening to so many books with such difficult subjects, but I do. This one will stand up there with many of the other difficult books. This story is about Ada, a very talented dressmaker, who is \"courted\" and convinced to go to Paris on the eve of World War II. When the war breaks out, Ada and the man she is falling in love with, flee to Belgium, where he deserts her. She is captured by the Nazis and winds up a prisoner in Dachau - though she is not with all the other prisoners, she is kept locked in a room by herself where she has only minimal contact with anyone - and no one is ever allowed to talk to her. But the women of the Nazi party find out that she is a dressmaker, so they begin to bring her fabric, and she has to make dresses for them - usually within 24 hours. She survives the war by doing what she has to do to stay alive. All of this part of the story makes sense to me, and is very well written. It's the after the war part of the story that I have trouble with. She has spent all this time, with her sanity beginning to slip, nearly starving to death, only to come home to start everything all over again. She really didn't learn anything during the war. This is the part of the book that I am going to have to think about for a few days. On the one hand, I said that she didn't learn anything and that doesn't seem real to me. However, on the other hand, I also said that she was losing her grasp of what was real. If that is true, perhaps she wouldn't grow and the story line as it is makes sense. I don't have to \"like\" it, but it does make sense. And, to make it even more difficult, the ending is the only one that could have come out of the time in which the story takes place. If the events of the last 2 parts had taken place in the 21st century, they would have had a completely different ending. As the old advertisement says: \"You've come a long way, baby.\"All in all, a difficult book, that I want to say I enjoyed, but the subject matter is just not the kind of thing that you \"enjoy\". You think about it - sometimes a lot - but you don't really \"enjoy\" it. An excellent book - difficult, but excellent. <><"}, {"userName": "Thebooktrail", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25264586-thebooktrail", "userReview": "Written against a real historical background of the outbreak of war in Europe, this is a tale of one woman\u2019s resilience despite tragedy.For the locations featured in the story - Booktrail of The Dressmaker of DachauAda leads a sad and uneventful life in Lambeth, London and so wants to escape her life.

The Dressmaker's war is a gritty rendition of the effects of World War II from the perspective of then 19 year old Ada Vaughan, who aspires to have the House of Vaughan and make a name for herself in dressmaking. The historical fictions about WWII are often written from the standpoint of the Jews who were most targeted and it was refreshing to gain the *albeit fictional* perspective of a young lady of a different race who gets caught in the stark reality of war.She leaves her home to go to Paris with a man who she believes to be her love, right before war is officially announced. She is woefully naive and blind to the oncoming war and thrusts herself in a situation that gets increasing worse. She ends up first as a pretend nun and is made to help the old, and then later is confined as a dressmaker to German generals. Good: The story picks up closer to part two, and you start to feel for her as she tells you what it's like to be her in the midst of the war. Not to give too much away about the ending, but you see Ada really speak out about being a woman with no say and limited rights and I really understood what she was trying to convey. It wasn't fair or right and women often got the short end of the stick (and still do sometimes). Yes Ada, yes!You also learn a bit about various fabrics. :PCould be better: There was SO much detail and it made the read pretty slow. Ada is ridiculously naive and keeps doing things that she convinces herself are not the way they are - in part this is PTSD, and her not great education, and her character. But ARGH stop doing dumb things girl!It took a long time to connect and the writing jolted around with short non-sentences and half thoughts from Ada. ___I forget sometimes that PTSD wasn't always known and I was SO irritated that sometimes people wouldn't understand what Ada was going through or even try to help her properly. That's so sad to me because what happened to her must have happened to many others and their lives wouldn't have gotten better with the way they were treated. The Dressmaker's War is a compelling book, and if you have the time and patience, will leave you feeling just like \"wow\"."}, {"userName": "Pupottina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21008693-pupottina", "userReview": "Per il giorno della memoria, quest'anno ho deciso di leggere LA SARTA DI DACHAU.L'autrice, Mary Chamberlain, professoressa di storia a Oxford, ha scelto di pubblicare questa storia per esordire nell'ambito letterario, romanzando una vicenda verosimilmente storica che intreccia un dramma tutto femminile con le crudeli pagine del Novecento. Mary Chamberlain ha ideato questa storia un po' per caso: mentre sfoglia un saggio sulla seconda guerra mondiale, scopre il mistero del vestito da sposa di Eva Braun, l'amante di Hitler, disegnato da una sarta sconosciuta. In quel preciso momento la sua fantasia comincia a viaggiare, immaginando una ragazza deportata in un campo di concentramento che ha il sogno di diventare stilista. Questa \u00e8 a genesi di La sarta di Dachau, il primo struggente romanzo di Mary Chamberlain.La storia inizia a Londra nel 1939, quando la protagonista diciassettenne, Ada Vaughan, sogna il suo futuro fatto d'amore e di splendidi abiti alla moda, abilmente modellati dalla sua mano di apprendista modista.Quando un elegante uomo inizia a corteggiarla, le sembra di vivere un sogno, dando poca importanza al fatto che parla tedesco. Lui, seducente ed elegante, che bada poco a spese, le propone un viaggio a Parigi. Per\u00f2, il romantico viaggio da cui sarebbe tornata con un anello al dito, si trasforma in un incubo che la porta nell'inferno del campo di concentramento di Dachau. Ada si aggrappa con tutte le forse al suo sogno romantico per rimanere in vita e, a guerra finita, tornare a casa dalla sua famiglia.Le donne naziste, invece, nonostante la guerra, non hanno smesso di vestire abiti alla moda e la bravura di Ada la porta a toccare ancora sete e tessuti preziosi dai quali ricavare abiti da sogno.Ada \u00e8 un esempio di coraggio. \u00c8 duro per una ragazza ingenua come lei scoprire quanto \u00e8 crudele e malvagio il genere umano, soprattutto in periodo di guerra. \u00c8 una ragazza che diventa donna e continua a lottare anche quando tutto sembra perduto."}, {"userName": "Theresa Smith Writes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25352638-theresa-smith-writes", "userReview": "I feel entirely mislead about this book. The blurb is not reflective of the story at all. This story had all the promise of greatness: a dressmaker in a concentration camp, surviving against the odds. I was instantly intrigued. Well for a start, the dressmaker wasn't in a camp. Yes, she was kept prisoner, and her story was still an intriguing one, but why mislead on the cover? There was no love story either, again, deliberately misleading. Nor was she abandoned in Paris. As frustrating as I found this poorly written blurb, the book turned out to be equally as disappointing. The style of writing was very impersonal and disjointed. I never felt Ada and her struggle. I never felt her misery. I read about it, but the author never once made me feel. Only just over half of this book relates to Ada and her experiences as a Nazi dressmaker. From this, the author took Ada back to London and decided to turn her into a delusional prostitute. I should have stopped reading then. Towards the end of the story, we find out that events in the war were not quite what they seemed at the time. We were left to consider that Ada truly was delusional, so what else was a lie? I really did not like this inference. The author should have just been up front at the outset, it would have made for a more credible main character. The ending was atrocious. Probably historically accurate, but awful still. I feel as though the author had a fantastic idea for a story but got sick of it half way through and decided to write another without changing books.
